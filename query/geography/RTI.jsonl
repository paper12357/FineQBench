{"question":"Explain the detailed processes of the carbon cycle.","answer":"The carbon cycle describes the continuous movement of carbon among the atmosphere, land, oceans, and long-term geological reservoirs. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis and stored as plant biomass, while plant respiration returns part of this carbon back to the air. When plants die, carbon is transferred to soils, where microbial decomposition and respiration release carbon back into the atmosphere, with some remaining stored in soil for long periods. Terrestrial ecosystems as a whole currently act as a net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than they emit. In the ocean, carbon dioxide is exchanged with the atmosphere through air–sea gas exchange. Phytoplankton absorb dissolved carbon during photosynthesis, incorporating it into marine biomass. Respiration and decomposition in the ocean return carbon to surface waters, while some carbon sinks into the deep ocean, where it can be stored for centuries to millennia. Human activities, especially fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land-use change, add significant amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. These emissions disrupt the natural balance of the carbon cycle, leading to a net annual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide."}
