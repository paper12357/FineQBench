Juventus Football Club (Italian pronunciation: [juˈvɛntus]; from iuventūs, Latin for 'youth'), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (pronounced [ˈjuːve]), is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Turinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and plays now in Juventus Stadium.
Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora ("the Old Lady"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record). Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.
Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.
Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.
The club's fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo ("anti-parochialism") and italianità ("Italianness"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.


== History ==


=== Early years (1897–1918) ===

Juventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari. It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese.

In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.
There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. Alfred Dick, the club's president, was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole. Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.
In 1913, Juventus was relegated to the second division after ended in last place, but after pressure made by their executives to the Italian Federation, it was decided to increase the number of teams in the following season, that permitted Juventus to remain in the top league.


=== League dominance (1923–1980) ===

In 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club's president. These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1. The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base. This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others.
Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949–50 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951–52 Serie A. For the 1957–58 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959–60 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959–60 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.

During the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966–67 Serie A. The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the scudetto in the 1971–72 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972–73 Serie A, with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and helped the club's domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.


=== European stage (1980–1993) ===

The club led under Trapattoni in the 1980s brought them the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the first Italian club to achieve this. Around this time, the club's players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.
Frenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record at that time. Juventus are the first and one of the only two clubs to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years. It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football. That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions; after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first and thus far the only in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions, an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup.
With the exception of winning the closely contested 1985–86 Serie A, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the 1989–90 Coppa Italia and the 1990 UEFA Cup final under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff. In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world football transfer record fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the 1993 UEFA Cup final.


=== Renewed international success (1994–2004) ===

Marcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994–95 Serie A. His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the 1995 Coppa Italia final. The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli, and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.
The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi, and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996–97 Serie A, successfully defended their title in the 1997–98 Serie A, won the 1996 UEFA Super Cup, and followed through with the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. Juventus reached two consecutive Champions League finals during this period but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid, respectively in 1997 and 1998.
After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal, signing big name players like Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd, and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to win the 2001–02 Serie A, which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the 2002–03 Serie A. Juventus were also part of the all Italian 2003 UEFA Champions League final but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus's history.


=== Calciopoli scandal (2004–2007) ===
In 2004, Fabio Capello was appointed head coach of Juventus and led the team to first-place finishes in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 Serie A seasons. In May 2006, Juventus was implicated in the Calciopoli scandal, a major investigation into alleged sporting fraud involving several Italian football clubs. As a result, in July 2006, the club was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history and stripped of its 2004–05 Serie A title. After a period of legal deliberation, the 2005–06 title was awarded to third-placed Inter Milan.
The decisions surrounding Calciopoli remain a subject of ongoing debate and controversy. Although Juventus executives Luciano Moggi and Antonio Giraudo received lifetime bans from football, subsequent legal proceedings in ordinary courts did not find Juventus, as a club, guilty of criminal wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the club chose not to pursue an appeal in Italian civil courts. This decision came after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and ban Italian clubs from international competitions if the matter was not resolved within the sport’s internal justice system. Critics have questioned various aspects of the process, including the reasoning behind Juventus’s relegation, such as the use of an ad hoc regulation and the cited "sentimento popolare" (public sentiment). Further controversy has stemmed from later suggestions of possible misconduct involving other clubs, including Inter Milan, and from rulings that determined the 2004–05 championship had not been fixed.

Many key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, midfielders Emerson and Patrick Vieira, and defensive stalwarts Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluca Zambrotta; other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedvěd, as well as the club's future defense core Giorgio Chiellini, remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the Cadetti title (Serie B championship) despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back up to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the 2006–07 Serie B season.
As early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, Livorno, and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetto from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of Calciopoli trials connected to the 2006 scandal. When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015, the club sued the FIGC for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.
In September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. As did the Naples court in 2012, the court commented that the developments and behavior of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth. Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy's courts, both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in March 2020; Giraudo's was accepted in September 2021. Juventus continued to present new appeals, which were declared inadmissible.


=== Return to Serie A (2007–2011) ===
After making their comeback for the 2007–08 Serie A, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League's third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008–09 Serie A, before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 Serie A.
Ferrara's stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, and also of the 2009–10 Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 Serie A, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium, known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.


=== Nine consecutive scudetti (2011–2020) ===

With Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire 2011–12 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format. In 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins. The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history. They also achieved the semi-finals of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica's catenaccio, missing the 2014 UEFA Europa League final at the Juventus Stadium.

In the 2014–15 Serie A, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia, after beating Lazio 2–2 in the 2015 Coppa Italia final, for the domestic double. The club also beat Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League to face Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League final in Berlin for the first time since the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3–1. In the 2016 Coppa Italia final, the club won the title for the 11th time and second straight win, becoming the first team in Italy's history to win Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons. In the 2017 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles. Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. In the 2017 UEFA Champions League final, their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid; the 2017 Turin stampede happened ten minutes before the end of the match. In the 2018 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 13th title and fourth in a row in a 4–0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles. Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. 

Juventus, eager to secure the Champions League title, signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £99.2 million from Real Madrid on 10 July 2018. In Italy, the signing was dubbed the "deal of the century." For Juventus, the signing of Ronaldo went beyond football—it represented a step toward elevating the club's status as a global business. Deloitte ranked the world's richest clubs earlier in the year and Juventus ranked 10th; by leveraging Ronaldo's massive social media following and commercial appeal, the club expected to close the financial gap with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United. In the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eight title after beating Milan 1–0. In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. Following Allegri's departure, Maurizio Sarri was appointed manager of the club ahead of the 2019–20 season. Juventus were confirmed 2019–20 Serie A champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles.


=== Recent history (2020–present) ===
On 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League by Lyon. On the same day, former player Andrea Pirlo was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract. With Inter Milan's win of the 2020–21 Serie A, Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles came to an end; the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season's Champions League. Despite the fact Pirlo had won two seasonal trophies—the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana— he was sacked from his managerial position in late May 2021. Allegri agreed to return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract. During the three seasons that featured Ronaldo, the Champions League all-time top scorer, Juventus disappointingly failed to win the Champions League. Ronaldo left the club for Manchester United in late August 2021.
Although Allegri had considered the victory of the scudetto as a seasonal goal, Juventus reached another fourth place in the league. After losing 4–2 after extra time to Inter Milan in the 2022 Coppa Italia final, the 2021–22 Juventus F.C. season marked the first season since 2010–11 in which the club had not won a trophy. In the 2022–23 season, Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition's group stage. The team finished third in the group stage and dropped down into the Europa League, in which they were defeated 2–1 by Sevilla away in the semi-final. Meanwhile, on 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors had resigned from their respective positions, Andrea Agnelli as president, Pavel Nedvěd as vice president, and Maurizio Arrivabene as CEO. Agnelli's presidency was the most victorious of the club's history, with 19 titles won. Exor, the club's controlling shareholder, appointed Gianluca Ferrero as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2023.
Two days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC's Court of Appeal in April–May 2022, Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations, as part of an investigation related to the 2019–2021 budgets during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in November 2021. Following Juventus's appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023, but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May. Within the aforementioned FIGC's inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a plea bargain for their false accounting on staff salaries; the request was accepted one day later and Juventus only received a fine of €718,240 without any further penalty. Juventus finished the 2022–23 Serie A in seventh place and qualified to the UEFA Europa Conference League. However, on 28 July, UEFA ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year as the club violated a settlement agreement with UEFA signed in August 2022. The 2023–24 season was the first in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions since 2011–12. 
Due to their UEFA competition ban, Juventus only had the Serie A title and Coppa Italia to play for during the 2023–24 season. In Serie A Juventus finished the season in third place. In the Coppa Italia, Juventus made the final where they faced Atalanta. Juventus won the final 1–0 after an early goal from Dušan Vlahović, earning the Turin club their 15th Coppa Italia title. That was Allegri's sole trophy during his second stint. However the game was not without controversy, Allegri was sent off in stoppage time after shouting at the 4th official. Allegri after leaving the pitch was reported to have attacked the referees, threatened a journalist and waved off sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli during the post match celebrations. 
Despite winning the Coppa Italia, two days after the final Juventus announced they had sacked Allegri, mainly due to his behaviour during the game not being in line with the club's values, Paolo Montero took charge for the final two league games of the season. 
On 12 June 2024, Juventus announced that former Bologna coach and Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta would become their new head coach for the 2024–25 season, on a three-year contract. Ahead of the 2024–25 season, Juventus spent almost €200 million in the football market, which included the signings of midfielders Teun Koopmeiners and Douglas Luiz (both paid about €50 milion). However, Motta was sacked in March 2025, and was replaced by former 1990s and 2000s footballer Igor Tudor.


== Crest and colours ==

Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1901–02 season. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in December 1901 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.
Juventus's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.
In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the change to the Juventus badge for a logotype. More specifically, it is a pictogram composed by a stylised Black and White "J" which Agnelli said reflects "the Juventus way of living." Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a star as a symbol associated with any competition's triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.
In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was concave in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two "Golden Stars for Sport Excellence" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus's emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club's name forming an arc above.
Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 title and did not assign them the 2005–06 title due to their involvement in the Calciopoli scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the following season, but added the message "30 sul campo" ("30 on the pitch", referring to the two titles that were won but vacated) underneath the badge. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars "to emphasise the difference". For the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season. For the 2016–17 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes. For the 2017–18 season, Juventus introduced the J shaped logo onto the kits.
In September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck. J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.
During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The "old" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means "youth" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The "lady" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (lit. 'the Girlfriend of Italy'), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include [la] Madama (Piedmontese for Madam), i bianconeri (lit. 'the black-and-whites'), le zebre (lit. 'the zebras') in reference to Juventus's colours. I gobbi (lit. 'the hunchbacks') is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.
The official anthem of Juventus is Juve (storia di un grande amore), or Juve (story of a great love) in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007. In 2016, a documentary film called Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story was produced by the La Villa brothers about Juventus.

== Stadiums ==

After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which they played at the Corso Re Umberto.
From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Benito Mussolini inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches. The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.
From 1990 until the 2005–06 season, Juventus contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi in Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan.
In August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season. Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the Allianz Stadium of Turin until 30 June 2030.


== Supporters ==

Juventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi, as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated. Juventus has fan clubs branches across the globe.
Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.


== Club rivalries ==

Juventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.
Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.
Their most high-profile rivalry is with Inter Milan, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.
The rivalry with AC Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled and two of the most supported teams in Italy. The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.
They also have rivalries with Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.


== Youth programme ==

The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents. While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting. On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called Juventus U23 (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022), playing in Serie C, who won the Coppa Italia Serie C in 2020. In the 2021–22 UEFA Youth League, the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.
The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.

Since 1949, they have been often corporate managers that were nominated in charge by the assemblea degli azionisti (stakeholders assembly).
