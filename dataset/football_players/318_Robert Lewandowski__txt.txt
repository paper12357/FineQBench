On 17 December, Lewandowski set the Bundesliga record for most goals in a calendar year with his 43rd goal. He became the second player, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to be the top goalscorer for club and country as a player playing in Europe for three consecutive years.
On 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4–0 away win over Köln. On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi's previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd Müller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals. In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.
On 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying "My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone."


=== Barcelona ===


==== Transfer ====
At Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer. Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of €45 million, potentially rising to €50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at €500 million. Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time. Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.


==== 2022–23: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy ====
On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0–0 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league. On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4–1 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August, followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4–0 victory on 28 August. On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 victory over Viktoria Plzeň, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs. On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his fifth league match for Barcelona, in their 4–0 win over Cádiz, setting the record for most goals in the first five La Liga games of the season in the 21st century, and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October.
On 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last-minute equalizer securing a 3–3 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou. Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season. On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David García, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2–1 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1–1 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atlético Madrid, Girona and Getafe.
On 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de España final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in El Clásico, winning his first title with the club. On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4–2, confirming them as La Liga champions. He was the first Barcelona player to score more than 30 goals across all competitions in his debut season since Ronaldo Nazário in 1996–97. By the end of the 2022–23 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches, becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons. Lewandowski also tied Lionel Messi for most top scorer awards in top 5 European leagues with eight.


==== 2023–24: La Liga runner-up ====

On 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5–0 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He also became the oldest player, at 35 years and 29 days, to score for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, surpassing Gerard Piqué's previous record. On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century, with 35 goals, surpassing the record previously held by Samuel Eto'o.
On 17 February 2024, Lewandowski secured a win for Barcelona in a 2–1 victory over Celta Vigo by converting a retaken 97th-minute penalty. He became the most successful footballer in terms of the number of goals scored (407) over the past decade in the top five major European football leagues.
On 22 February, he scored his 93rd Champions League goal in a 1–1 draw against Napoli. Then on 12 March, Lewandowski scored the final goal in a 3–1 win in the home leg, knocking out Napoli with a 4–2 aggregate score. On 17 March, he was a key player in Barcelona's 3–0 win over Atlético Madrid having been involved in all three goals. He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4–2 win against Valencia.


==== 2024–25: Domestic double and 100 Barcelona goals ====
On 17 August 2024, Lewandowski scored two goals in a 2–1 victory against Valencia. It was the first match of the La Liga season for Barcelona and the first game with former Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick in charge as the coach. On 22 September, Lewandowski scored two goals in a 5–1 victory against Villarreal. On 25 September, he scored the winning goal in Barcelona's 1–0 victory over Getafe. This was Lewandowski's 49th goal scored in La Liga beating Jan Urban's record as the top scoring Polish player in La Liga history. On 6 October, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 victory over Alavés. On 20 October, Lewandowski scored two goals in a 5–1 victory against Sevilla, in the process, he overtook Gerd Müller's record and became the third highest scorer in the history of the five major European football leagues with 366 goals in total. 
On 23 October, Lewandowski scored the second goal in a 4–1 thrashing of his former club Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but did not celebrate out of respect for Bayern. Then on 26 October 2024, Lewandowski scored the first and second goal in Barcelona's 4–0 away demolition of Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. He was subsequently chosen La Liga Player of the Month, his third such achievement. On 23 November, he scored against Celta Vigo in a match, which concluded in a 2–2 draw. By scoring this goal, Lewandowski recorded his 14th consecutive season in which he scored at least 20 goals for club, surpassing Lionel Messi's record. Three days later, Lewandowski made history by netting a brace in Barcelona's 3–0 win over Brest, his first goal in the match being his 100th Champions League goal. He became only the third player to pass the 100-goal mark in the Champions League. On 7 December, he netted a goal in a 2–2 draw against Real Betis. By scoring the goal, Lewandowski reached 16 goals in his first 16 La Liga matches, equalling a record achieved by Messi during the 2018–19 season.
On 9 April 2025, Lewandowski surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo as the player with the most goals past the age of thirty-five in the Champions League, 14. He reached this feat against former club Borussia Dortmund after scoring a brace in a 4–0 victory over the German side. Those goal involvements also led him to his 99th Barcelona goal, and becoming the Man of the Match. He reached his 100th and 101st goals with the club in a 3–0 away win over Athletic Bilbao on the final matchday of the season. This made him join the small group of players to have scored 100 goals with three different clubs, and only the third player from the 21st century to do so after Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar.


== International career ==


=== 2007–2013: Youth level and early international career ===

Lewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.
His debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2–0 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only Włodzimierz Lubański scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10–0 victory.
Playing in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub Błaszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.


=== 2013–2017: Assuming captaincy ===

Lewandowski scored two penalties in the 5–0 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1–1 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
On 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7–0 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4–0 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2–2 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2–1 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.
At UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-Étienne. Following the 1–1 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade Vélodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1–1 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.


=== 2017–2025: All-time Poland top scorer, short-lived retirement ===

On 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 victory against Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by Włodzimierz Lubański to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4–2 victory against Montenegro, taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with a total of 16 goals, a record for a European World Cup qualification.
Lewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches against Senegal, Colombia, and Japan. He did not score any goals and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.
On 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group stage match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw. He became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 3–2 defeat against Sweden, but Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out in the group stage.
Lewandowski was selected for the national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first match against Mexico, he missed a penalty. However, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, Lewandowski scored his first FIFA World Cup goal Poland 2–0. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3–1 loss against France in the round of 16.
In June 2024, Lewandowski was named in the final 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany. In Poland's third group stage game, he converted a penalty kick to equalize in a 1–1 draw against France, but Poland exited the tournament after finishing at the bottom of their group.
Lewandowski was not called up for two June 2025 matches against Moldova and Finland, citing exhaustion after the end of the club season. On 8 June, following the decision of head coach Michał Probierz to name Piotr Zieliński new captain of the Poland national team, Lewandowski announced he would not play for the national team as long as Probierz was the manager. Following Lewandowski's remarks and Poland's defeat against Finland in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Probierz resigned.
Following the appointment of Jan Urban as Poland manager on 16 July 2025, reports of Lewandowski's national team return ahead of the September matches against the Netherlands and Finland surfaced. In August 2025, he was selected for the September games and reinstated as Poland's captain.


== Style of play ==

Lewandowski was widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world in his prime, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of his generation. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness.
Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers; his disciplined approach to training and fitness has led to him being nicknamed "The Body".


== Outside football ==


=== Personal life ===

Lewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.
His wife, Anna Lewandowska (née Stachurska), won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two children, born in 2017 and 2020.
Lewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7–1 win over Roma in the UEFA Champions League.
In October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies.

Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gaweł, a three-year-old boy from Hel; and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.
In March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the "Voice of the Children" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.
In 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.
In March 2020, Lewandowski and his wife, Anna, donated €1 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy. Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.
In February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match. The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.
Beside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder. He also owns Stor9_, an agency specialising in marketing communications. In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the "List of 100 Richest Poles" compiled by the Wprost magazine.


=== Sponsorship and media appearances ===

In 2016, a mobile game Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016 was released on Android and iOS platforms.
In March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.
Lewandowski featured on the cover of the Polish edition of EA Sports' FIFA 15 video game, alongside Lionel Messi. Lewandowski's "X" goal celebration—arms crossed and index fingers pointing up—has appeared in EA Sports' FIFA series since FIFA 18.
In 2022, Lewandowski was the most popular Pole on social media. His accounts on Instagram, YouTube and Tik Tok were followed by over 62 million people. In 2023, he was the subject of a documentary film entitled Lewandowski − Nieznany (Lewandowski − Unknown), which premiered on 28 March and is available on Amazon Prime.
