Jonas Magnus Thern (born 20 March 1967) is a Swedish football manager who manages Allsvenskan club IFK Värnamo. 
As a player, Thern was a midfielder. Starting his career with Malmö FF in 1985, he went on to represent FC Zürich, Benfica, Napoli, Roma and Rangers before retiring in 1999.
A full international between 1987 and 1997, Thern won 75 caps for Sweden and captained the side that finished third at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He also represented his country at the UEFA Euro 1992 on home soil, as well as the 1988 Summer Olympics and 1990 FIFA World Cup.


== Club career ==
Born in Falköping and raised in Värnamo, Thern started his professional career in 1985 at Malmö FF, where he stayed for four years and won two Allsvenskan titles in 1986 and 1988.
In 1989, Thern received the Guldbollen as Sweden's Footballer of the Year. That same year, he left for Benfica as part of a successful group of Scandinavian players that played there at the same time, such as Danish international Michael Manniche (1983–1987) and the Swedish "armada" of Mats Magnusson (1987–1992), Thern (1989–1992), Glenn Strömberg (1982–84) and Stefan Schwarz (1990–94). Benfica were also coached by a Swede, Sven-Göran Eriksson (1982–1984 and 1989–1992).
Thern then played in Italy for Napoli and Roma. In 1997, he joined Rangers in Scotland, a move that lasted merely two years but nonetheless accompanied by silverware, a league title in 1999 – his final year in professional football – as frequent injuries forced him to retire early.


== International career ==
For Sweden, he played in the 1990 FIFA World Cup and Euro 1992, and then won the bronze medal in the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. Thern also competed for Sweden at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Thern was the Sweden captain for seven years, between 1990 and 1997.


== Coaching career ==
After he retired as a player he became head coach for IFK Värnamo between 2000 and 2001 and Halmstads BK 2001–2003.
In 2021, he led IFK Värnamo to promotion to Allsvenskan for the first time ever in the club's history.


== Personal life ==
Jonas has a son, Simon, who is also a footballer. His daughter, Alicia, is an equestrian.
