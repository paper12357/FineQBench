Bernd Schuster (born 22 December 1959) is a German former professional footballer of the late 1970s through early 1990s, who won club titles playing for the Spanish sides Barcelona (1980–1988) and Real Madrid (1988–1990). He played as a midfielder and was nicknamed "der Blonde Engel" (the Blond Angel). After retiring as a player, he managed a number of European clubs, including Real Madrid, taking them to the league title in the 2007–08 season.


== Club career ==
Schuster started his professional career with 1. FC Köln at age 18 in 1978 after a number of promising performances with the West German Under-18 National team. Schuster left Köln after the 1980 European campaign to sign with Spain's FC Barcelona, where he flourished. During his career, he played for clubs Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen. At his final team, the Mexican side Pumas de la UNAM he appeared in ten matches in spring 1997.


=== Barcelona ===

Schuster contributed significantly to FC Barcelona during the 1980s, playing as a midfielder and regularly scoring goals, as evidenced by his goal tally during this period. His club president Josep Lluís Núñez and some trainers like Helenio Herrera, Udo Lattek, Terry Venables and Luis Aragonés had difficult relations with him. While in Barcelona, though, he won the European Silver Ball in 1980 and the Bronze Ball in 1981 and 1985. 
At age 21, in 1981, he was badly injured on his right knee by Athletic Bilbao  defender Andoni Goikoetxea, who had a reputation for aggressive tackling, as noted in contemporaneous accounts.
In 2024, Pep Guardiola, was asked in an interview to name the five players he'd pick from football history to play in a five-a-side and, among them, picked Schuster, whom, he said, he used to watch as a ball boy at the stadium and "was completely in love" with his playing.


=== Real Madrid ===
Schuster's move to Real Madrid was controversial due to the strong rivalry between Barcelona and Madrid. His style complemented the group of home-grown Madrid players known as la Quinta del Buitre, who were instrumental in the team's success in the Spanish Championship during the 1980s.


=== Atlético Madrid ===
Schuster signed with Atlético Madrid in autumn 1990 and helped improve the performance of Atlético. His long precise passes helped restore Atlético Madrid as a prominent club.


=== Bayer Leverkusen ===
In 1993, Schuster returned home to Germany to play for three seasons with Bayer Leverkusen. Despite his contributions, the club was unable to capture Bundesliga and German Cup titles but his performances led to discussions among fans and pundits about his potential inclusion in the 1994 World Cup squad. In the national TV-Station ARD "Goal of the year" election Schuster won the first three places in 1994. In the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll to name the finest European players of the last five decades, Schuster finished 40th.


== International career ==
Schuster was part of the West Germany national team that won the 1980 UEFA European Football Championship in Italy, appearing in two of West Germany's four matches. His performances there helped him earn the Silver Ball Trophy honour as the Europe's second best player in 1980 behind Golden Ball winner, and West Germany team-mate Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. His refusal to take part in a match against Albania to be home for the birth of his second son David caused a sporting scandal at the time. Schuster retired from the West Germany national team at the age of 24, due to his repeated disagreements with the German Football Association, then national team manager Jupp Derwall, and teammates including Paul Breitner. According to Schuster, it was due to a major disagreement with the managements of both Barcelona and the West Germany national team on either side of a friendly match against Brazil. Overall Schuster won 21 caps for the then West Germany national team


== Style of play ==
An intelligent and skillful player, Schuster is considered one of the best midfielders of his generation. Earlier in his career, Schuster operated as a box-to-box attacking midfielder with good creative abilities, good dribbling and good pace. Injuries at Barcelona would cause him to lose his pace, which led his coaches to move him to a deep-lying playmaking role, where his technique, vision and excellent passing abilities allowed him to excel at dictating the tempo of the game and provide chances for his teammates through short and long passes. He was also an expert free-kick taker and possessed a powerful shot that allowed him to score goals from a distance. Primarily a midfielder, Schuster was also capable of playing as a sweeper, a position that he played in his years as a youngster at Köln and at Real Madrid, where his creativity and technique allowed him to start attacks from the back.
Schuster was also praised for his leadership skills and commanding presence on the pitch. Despite his talent as a player, Schuster struggled with injuries throughout his career and was known for his outspoken nature, which sometimes led to disagreements with coaches, players, and journalists. He was nicknamed "The Blonde Angel" because of his long blonde hair.
Many coaches and players have praised Schuster's talent as a footballer. Schuster's first coach at Köln Hennes Weisweiler described him as the best player he ever coached, and believed he could have been Franz Beckenbauer's successor. An admirer of Schuster, Köln coach Rinus Michels lamented his departure to Barcelona, believing that it was impossible to find a perfect replacement for him. Atlético Madrid coach Luis Aragonés praised his reading of the game and ability to play the right pass at the right time. 
Marcel Desailly and Xavi have cited Schuster as an idol.
