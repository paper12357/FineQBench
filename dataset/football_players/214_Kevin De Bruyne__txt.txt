After spending most of his youth career at Gent, De Bruyne began his professional senior career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then loaned to Werder Bremen.

Making 422 appearances for the club, he won the UEFA Champions League, six Premier League titles, five League Cups, and two FA Cups. In 2017–18, he had a significant role in City becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single league season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne equalled the record for most assists in a Premier League season and was named Player of the Season, the award he won for the second time in 2021–22. He was again heavily involved in 2022–23, as Manchester City sealed the continental treble in their most successful season to date.

He followed this up with a goal in Bremen's next match, securing a place in the Bundesliga for the next season with a 1–1 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt on 11 May.

I would not go to England just to prove that I can play there. I do not have to go to England... If I go there it's because for me and for my family it is a good choice. That's the key for me."
On 10 August, it was reported that Manchester City had made a second bid for De Bruyne worth £47 million.

== Player profile ==


=== Style of play ===
A versatile and highly talented player in the media, he plays mainly as an attacking or a central midfielder but can also operate in several other positions and has been used as a winger or second striker. He has even been deployed in a deeper creative midfield position and on occasion, a box-to-box role or as a false 9. He is often described by pundits as one of the best and most complete modern day advanced playmakers due to his technique, skill, athleticism, work-rate off the ball, vision, crossing accuracy, wide range of passing, and powerful long-range shooting ability with either foot.
Although he is not blessed with significant physical strength, pace, or ability in the air, he is a quick and elegant player on the ball with good dribbling skills, while his positional sense, tactical intelligence, movement, direct style of play and ability to run at defences when in possession also enable him to take advantage of spaces in the opposition's defence and subsequently create chances and goalscoring opportunities for himself or his team-mates, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks. In addition to his creative abilities, he is also capable of scoring goals by making late runs off the ball from behind into the penalty area and is an accurate set-piece taker.


=== Reception ===
At his peak, De Bruyne was widely regarded as one of the best players in the world, and he has often been described as a "complete" footballer.
De Bruyne was ranked the fourth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian in 2017 and the twelfth-best in 2019. In 2020, his Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola described him as the best midfielder in the world. As City chased The Treble in the 2022–23 season with De Bruyne playing a leading role, Jamie Redknapp said that De Bruyne was the best Premier League midfielder he had seen, ranking him above the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.


== Personal life ==


=== Family and relationships ===
De Bruyne's mother is Belgian. She was born in Burundi and has also lived in the Ivory Coast. She grew up in London, after her Flemish parents moved to England for work reasons. Only when she met Kevin's father, Herwig, did she return to Belgium.
De Bruyne's parents settled in Drongen, a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent, in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Aside from Dutch, his mother tongue, De Bruyne also speaks English, French and German.
As a child, De Bruyne and his parents regularly visited his grandparents in London. At the time of his move to Chelsea in 2012, De Bruyne stated: "We used to go every year at Christmas and during school holidays. It's my second home."
De Bruyne has been in a relationship with Michèle Lacroix since 2014. The couple married in June 2017 and have three children together.
De Bruyne's autobiography, titled Keep It Simple, was published by Borgerhoff & Lamberigts in October 2014, following an incident between De Bruyne and his compatriot, footballer Thibaut Courtois, in which De Bruyne's then-girlfriend left him for Courtois. De Bruyne wrote in his autobiography, "Although I still cannot believe what Courtois has done, we continue to work together professionally."


=== Philanthropy ===
De Bruyne was an ambassador for the 2014 Special Olympics, which took place in Antwerp, and was involved in a controversial advertisement campaign via his personal Instagram account. Employing the slogan (in Dutch): "Would you still be my fan if I looked like this?", De Bruyne was depicted resembling a person with Down's syndrome.
Since 2016 the Kevin De Bruyne Cup, an international youth football tournament, has been organised in Drongen, Belgium.
De Bruyne was chosen by UEFA as ambassador for 2018. He presented a check worth 100,000 euros to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
In 2019, De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku handed out shoes to needy children in regional hospitals for a special campaign 'Kicks for Kids' organised by Roc Nation Sports.
De Bruyne has also been involved in other charitable initiatives, including the "Common Goal" campaign, which encourages professional footballers to donate 1% of their wages to support various global social causes. In addition, he has donated money to support cancer research and has been involved in charity matches to raise money for various causes.
In 2023, De Bruyne and his wife were named as ‘godparents’ of the Ronald McDonald Children's Fund, which ensures that parents with hospitalised children will be able to stay nearby.
