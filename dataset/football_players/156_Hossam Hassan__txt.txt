== Club career ==
Other than two spells abroad in Switzerland and Greece, the Cairo-born Hassan played mainly for his hometown's Al Ahly, for which he made his first-team debut aged 18; he played his last match for the club sixteen years later. He ranked first in the club in several categories and won a total of 25 titles with it, including 11 leagues; he was one of only two players ever to find the net in derbies for each team.
During his spell at Neuchâtel Xamax in Switzerland he is best remembered for scoring four goals in one game against Celtic in the 1991–92 UEFA Cup. In 2000, already at 34, Hassan left Al-Ahly, going to represent Al Ain SCC.
In the summer of 2000, Hassan moved to Zamalek, winning three Egyptian Premier League titles (in 2000–01, 2001–02 and 2003–04) with the Cairo giants, in addition to the 2002 Egypt Cup and the Egyptian Super Cup in 2001 and 2002. At the continental level, Hassan won with Zamalek the 2002 CAF Champions League, 2003 CAF Super Cup, 2003 UAFA Club Cup and the 2003 Saudi-Egyptian Super Cup. He scored four goals for his team in the Cairo derby, and scored 50 goals for Zamalek in all competitions.
Afterwards, he moved in 2004 to Al-Masry Club, Tersana and Al-Ittihad Al-Sakndary respectively, while continuing to score at length. He retired aged almost 42, having played most of the time with his sibling Ibrahim, including abroad.


== International career ==
He appeared for the nation at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, helping the Pharaohs achieve two draws while narrowly going down 0–1 to England. Ibrahim was also an undisputed starter.
Aged 40, Hassan was captain of the national team at the 2006 African Cup of Nations, and played three times and netted once for the hosts, winning the last of his three continental competitions.


== Coaching career ==
On 29 February 2008, Hassan was named both general manager and coach of former club Al-Masry, before signing at modest Itesalat.
After the sacking of French coach Henri Michel, he was named manager of former side Zamalek, on 30 November 2009. his first match in charge was on 3 December, which ended in a controversial 1–2 away loss against Haras El Hodood, as opposing player Ahmed Eid Abdel Malek was not supposed to play in that match, having been sent off the previous one (Abdel Malek ended up playing, and scored Hodood's first goal).
Hassan's first win at Zamalek came on the 12th, against Al-Masry (3–0). In twelve matches he took the club from 14th place to second, only losing one game and drawing another, before being sacked.
He later had short spells with Ismaily, Al Masry and Misr Lel Makkasa. He then became the head coach of Jordan, where he led the team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, including the AFC fifth round against Uzbekistan, then at the AFC–CONMEBOL play-off against Uruguay.
Later on, he returned to Egypt to coach Zamalek, Al Ittihad Alexandria, then Al Masry from 2015 to 2018, where he reached the 2017 Egypt Cup Final, and semi-final of the 2018 CAF Confederation Cup. Afterwards, he managed Pyramids and Smouha, before returning to coach Al Ittihad Alexandria in October 2020.
Due to undisclosed reasons, he parted ways with Al-Ittihad Alexandria, then returned for the 4th time to Al-Masry on 30 May 2022. After leaving the club by the end of the season, Hassan returned to Al-Masry for a 5th tenure in December 2022. In May 2023, he was dismissed after  insulting board members during a match against Aswan.
A few days following his appointment as head coach of Modern Future, Hassan was released to become the manager of the Egyptian national team in February 2024.
