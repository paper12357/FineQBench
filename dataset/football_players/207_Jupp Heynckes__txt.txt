== Playing career ==


=== Club level ===
Heynckes played 369 matches in the German Bundesliga, scoring 220 goals. His tally is the fourth highest in this league, after Gerd Müller's 365 goals, Robert Lewandowski's 312, and Klaus Fischer's 268.

After playing for amateur club Grün-Weiß Holt as a youth, Heynckes started his professional career in 1964 with his hometown club Borussia Mönchengladbach who were then in the second division. In 1965, the club, managed by Hennes Weisweiler, achieved promotion to the Bundesliga, with the teenaged striker scoring 23 goals in 25 matches in his debut season.
In August 1965, Heynckes scored his first two Bundesliga goals against SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin. He scored 27 Bundesliga goals in two seasons for Borussia before joining Hannover 96, where he spent three years and scored 25 times in 86 league matches.
He returned to Mönchengladbach in 1970, with the club having just won the first league title in its history. With Heynckes, who scored 19 times in 33 matches, Gladbach became the first club to retain the Bundesliga title in 1970–71.
In the 1971–72 European Cup, Heynckes scored twice in an extraordinary 7–1 win against Italian champions Inter Milan. The match, however, was forced to be replayed after a drinks can had been thrown onto the pitch by a spectator, hitting Inter's Roberto Boninsegna. Borussia drew the replayed home leg 0–0 and were eliminated 4–2 on aggregate.
In 1973, after eliminating Dutch club Twente 5–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Borussia Mönchengladbach became the first German side to reach the final of the UEFA Cup. Borussia lost the away leg of the final against Liverpool 3–0 at Anfield, after the match initially had to be abandoned after 27 minutes due to a waterlogged pitch. During the match, Heynckes had a penalty kick saved by Ray Clemence, denying his side a decisive away goal. In the return leg, Heynckes scored both goals in Gladbach's 2–0 win. The English team, however, prevailed 3–2 on aggregate to lift the trophy. With 12 goals, Heynckes was joint top scorer of the competition with Twente's Jan Jeuring. Despite disappointment in Europe, Gladbach ended the 1972–73 season with success in the DFB-Pokal final, beating 1. FC Köln at the Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf.
In the 1973–74 season, Heynckes was joint top goalscorer in the Bundesliga, alongside Gerd Müller, with 30 goals. His Mönchengladbach side finished second in the table, with Müller's Bayern Munich winning a record third consecutive Bundesliga title. Heynckes was also the top scorer of the 1973–74 European Cup Winners' Cup with eight goals. In this competition, Borussia Mönchengladbach were knocked out in the semi-finals by Milan, losing 2–1 on aggregate.

In 1974–75, die Fohlen won their third Bundesliga title, with Heynckes finishing as the league's outright top goalscorer with 27 goals. The club also won its first European trophy with success in the UEFA Cup. After a 0–0 draw in the home leg of the final against Twente, Heynckes, who missed the home match, scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 away win in Enschede. This victory made Gladbach the first German winners of the UEFA Cup. Again, Heynckes was tournament top scorer, this time with ten goals. Altogether, Heynckes scored 23 goals in 21 games in the UEFA Cup, making him the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of the competition, and the only member of the top ten to have scored at a ratio of over a goal per game.
After regaining the title, Weisweiler left Borussia to become manager of Barcelona. He was replaced by Udo Lattek, under whom Heynckes would later begin his coaching career. Borussia Mönchengladbach went on to win the 1975–76 and 1976–77 Bundesliga titles, matching Bayern's feat of three titles in a row set earlier in the decade. In 1977, Borussia also reached its first European Cup final. In the previous season's competition, Heynckes had been top scorer with six goals. In 1976–77 European Cup, he was less prolific, scoring only one goal in the first round match against Austria Wien. In the final, Gladbach again lost out to Liverpool, losing 3–1 at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.
Heynckes scored 18 goals in the 1977–78 Bundesliga season, including five in the record 12–0 win against Borussia Dortmund on the final day of the season. However, this was not enough to secure a fourth successive title, as 1. FC Köln won their final match against FC St. Pauli 5–0 to take first place on goal difference. Heynckes scored four goals in the 1977–78 European Cup as the team reached the semi-finals, where they were again defeated by Liverpool. Altogether, Heynckes scored 51 goals in 64 matches in European club competitions. His average of 0.8 goals per match is only bettered by compatriot Gerd Müller, who achieved an average of 0.89 goals per match.
Heynckes ended his playing career in 1978 and began studying for his coaching licence at the Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln.
During his club career, he won four Bundesliga titles, one DFB-Pokal and one UEFA Cup. He is the fourth-highest goalscorer in Bundesliga history and Borussia Mönchengladbach's top goalscorer in the competition with 195 goals.

Heynckes was included in West Germany's squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which was held in West Germany. Despite his excellent form at club level, however, he spent most of the tournament on the bench as Gerd Müller, the national team's all-time top goalscorer, was used as the starting centre forward by coach Helmut Schön. Heynckes was in the starting line-up for West Germany's opening two fixtures against Chile and Australia but then played no further part due to injury and die Nationalelf won their second World Cup, beating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final at Munich's Olympiastadion. In 2013, Heynckes said of his experience at the 1974 World Cup, "I was in the starting lineup for the Germany national team competing for the World Cup, but after an injury I was sidelined for the entire final. This was the greatest disappointment of my life, but it spurred me on and became my greatest source of motivation."
