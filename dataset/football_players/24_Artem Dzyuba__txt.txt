== International career ==
Dzyuba was a part of the Russia U21 side that was competing in the 2011 European Under-21 Championship qualification. He made his national team debut on 11 November 2011 in a friendly against Greece. He was called up to the provisional squad for UEFA Euro 2012. He was not included on the finalized squad that Dick Advocaat chose for the competition.
After the 2014 World Cup, which Dzyuba also missed with Fabio Capello preferring Aleksandr Kokorin and Aleksandr Kerzhakov instead, he started to be called up regularly during the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. He scored his first goal against Liechtenstein on 8 September 2014, his side's final goal in a 4–0 rout of the minnows at the Arena Khimki. Exactly a year later, he scored four goals in a 7–0 win over the same opponents in the reverse fixture; he ended the campaign as Russia's top goalscorer with eight goals as they qualified for UEFA Euro 2016.

On 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad, and on 3 June, he was included in the final edition. He came on as a substitute in the opening game on 14 June and scored the third goal of a 5–0 win over Saudi Arabia. He continued his impressive performance by scoring a goal in the second match that Russia beat Egypt 3–1, sending Russia to the knockout stage for the first time. In the match against Spain in the Round of 16 on 1 July, he converted a penalty minutes before half-time, making the score 1–1. Dzyuba was then substituted in the second half and Russia eventually won the game 4–3 on penalties.
After the retirement of Sergei Ignashevich and Igor Akinfeev from the national team, Dzyuba became the team's captain. On 9 June 2019, he scored four goals in a UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying match against San Marino which ended in a 9–0 home rout, with Russia recording their biggest ever win while he took his international tally up to 20 goals. On 10 October, he scored his 23rd international goal, overhauling fellow Roman Pavlyuchenko in the tally.
On 8 November 2020, Dzyuba was dropped from the national team ahead of the Nations League matches against Moldova, Turkey, and Serbia, after an explicit video depicting him masturbating leaked and went viral.

On 11 May 2021, he was included in the preliminary extended 30-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020. On 2 June 2021, he was included in the final squad. He played the full match in Russia's opening game against Belgium on 12 June 2021 as Russia lost 3–0. He played 83 minutes in Russia's second game against Finland on 16 June 2021 as Russia won 1–0, and assisted on Aleksei Miranchuk's winning goal. On 21 June, he played all 90 minutes of Russia's final game against Denmark, scoring Russia's only goal from a penalty kick. They lost 4–1, and Russia were eliminated from the competition. However, with that goal against Denmark, he equaled Aleksandr Kerzhakov's record of 30 goals as all-time top scorer of the national team.
After a four year break from international duty, Dzyuba was re-called for the friendlies against Grenada and Zambia on March 2025. He scored his 31st international goal against Grenada, overtaking Kerzhakov on the all-time national team goalscorer list.


== Personal life ==
Dzyuba has three sons with his wife Kristina.
On 2 March 2022, Dzyuba and several other Russian players were tagged in an Instagram video by Ukrainian footballer Andriy Yarmolenko who criticized them for being silent during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the video, Yarmolenko said "I know that some of you like to show your balls on camera but now it is time for you to show your balls in real life", referring to Dzyuba's viral sex tape.  Dzyuba subsequently wrote an Instagram post stating that he is proud of his country. He refused to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine and maintained that the people of Russia are victims of double standards and racial discrimination. In March 2023, Dzyuba was added to Myrotvorets' list of people who are considered, by the authors of the website, to be "enemies of Ukraine".
