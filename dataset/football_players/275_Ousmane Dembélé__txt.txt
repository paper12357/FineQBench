Masour Ousmane Dembélé (French pronunciation: [us.man dan.be.le]; born 15 May 1997) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the France national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is one of ten players to have won the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and Ballon d'Or in their career.
Dembélé began his professional career at Rennes, where he was named Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year in his sole season with the first team. In 2016, he transferred to German club Borussia Dortmund, winning the DFB-Pokal in his debut campaign and scoring in the final. Regarded as one of the most promising young talents in world football, he joined Spanish side Barcelona in 2017 for an initial fee of €105 million, making him at the time the joint-second most expensive player in history, alongside Paul Pogba and behind Neymar. Although he did not fully meet the expectations placed on him at the club, Dembélé won multiple domestic honors with Barcelona, including three La Liga, two Copa del Rey, and two Supercopa de España titles. 
Dembélé returned to France in 2023, signing with Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of €50.4 million. In the 2024–25 season, he experienced a resurgence in his career, contributing 33 goals and 15 assists in 49 appearances as PSG won a continental treble. He was named Ligue 1 Player of the Year and UEFA Champions League Player of the Season, as well as finishing as the Ligue 1 top scorer. His performances earned him the 2025 Ballon d'Or.
After winning 20 caps and scoring five goals at youth level, Dembélé made his senior international debut for France in 2016. He was a member of the France squad that won the 2018 FIFA World Cup, also featuring at UEFA Euro 2020, the 2022 World Cup (finishing as runners-up) and Euro 2024.


== Early life and career ==
Dembélé was born in Vernon, Eure, in Normandy. His mother is Mauritanian-Senegalese from Waly Diantang, while his father is Malian. He took his first footballing steps in nearby Évreux, first at ALM Évreux and then at Évreux FC 27 between the ages of 12 and 13.


== Club career ==


=== Rennes ===

Dembélé made his senior debut for Rennes' reserve side in the Championnat de France Amateur, on 6 September 2014, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Zana Allée. He effectively set up Alseny Kourouma for the second goal of a 2–0 home win over the reserves of Breton rivals Guingamp. On 9 November, he scored his first career goal, again coming off the bench in a game at the Stade de la Piverdière, this time against the reserves of Laval. He totalled 13 goals in 18 games in his first season, including a hat-trick on 16 May 2015 in a 6–1 win over Hérouville.
On 6 November 2015, Dembélé made his professional debut for Rennes' first team in Ligue 1 against Angers, replacing Kamil Grosicki for the last five minutes of the game. On 22 November, he scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the first team against Bordeaux, opening a 2–2 draw at Roazhon Park. On 9 January 2016, Dembélé found the net again for Rennes, as they came from 0–2 down to draw 2–2 against regional rivals Lorient at home. On 6 March, he scored his first Ligue 1 hat-trick in a 4–1 victory over Nantes in the Derby Breton.
On 18 March, he scored his tenth goal of the season in a 5–2 win against Olympique de Marseille at the Stade Vélodrome. He ended his debut season with twelve goals from 29 matches, after scoring twice in a 3–1 win against Stade Reims on 2 April.
Rennes' sporting director Mikaël Silvestre compared Dembélé to Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he had seen arrive at Manchester United around the same age.


=== Borussia Dortmund ===

On 12 May 2016, Dembélé signed a five-year contract with German club Borussia Dortmund, effective 1 July. On 14 August, he made his debut in a 2–0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the DFL-Supercup. He scored his first goal for Dortmund on 20 September, in a Bundesliga encounter against VfL Wolfsburg, which Dortmund won 5–1 at the Volkswagen Arena. On 22 November, he scored the first Champions League goal of his career as the German club defeated Legia Warsaw 8–4 in a group stage meeting.
On 26 April 2017, in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against Bayern Munich, Dembélé assisted Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 69th-minute equaliser and scored the winning goal in the 74th minute, helping Dortmund reach the 2017 DFB-Pokal Final. On 27 May, in the decisive match against Eintracht Frankfurt at the Berlin Olympiastadion, he scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory as Dortmund clinched their first major title in five years. Dembélé was subsequently named man of the match. 
After scoring six goals and recording 13 assists during 2016–17, Dembélé was named to the Bundesliga Team of the Season and awarded the league's Rookie of the Season award.


=== Barcelona ===
On 25 August 2017, La Liga side Barcelona announced that they had reached an agreement to sign Dembélé for €105 million plus a reported €40 million add-ons. On 28 August, he had his medical and signed a five-year contract, with his buyout clause set at €400 million. Barcelona had sold Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for €222 million, so the deal meant that Dembélé became the joint-second most expensive player (in euros), along with Paul Pogba. Rennes received a reported €20 million from Borussia Dortmund as a result of the sale, and Évreux 27 were also due part of the fee. He was handed the number 11 shirt previously worn by Neymar.

Dembélé made his debut on 9 September as a 68th-minute substitute for Gerard Deulofeu in a 5–0 Derbi barceloní win over Espanyol at the Camp Nou, assisting the final goal by Luis Suárez.

On 11 December, he scored a remarkable solo goal against Tottenham Hotspur outpacing many defenders, finishing with a cool left footed shot past Hugo Lloris. He won the UEFA Champions League Goal of the Week for that goal.

He finished the season with 14 goals, 8 of them in the league, as his club managed to win another La Liga title.


==== 2019–21: Recurring injuries ====
Dembélé injured his left hamstring in the opening match of the 2019–20 La Liga season, a 0–1 defeat against Athletic Bilbao, and was expected to miss five weeks. He returned as a half-time substitute in Barcelona's 2–1 home win over Villarreal on 24 September. He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–0 win over Sevilla on 6 October, but was later sent off for dissent. On 27 November, in a Champions League group match against his former club Borussia Dortmund, Dembélé suffered an injury which led to his substitution after 24 minutes. It was later confirmed by Barcelona that he would miss the following ten weeks with a thigh injury.
In February 2020, on his return to training, he suffered a serious hamstring tear which ended his season.
Dembélé returned to the field for the first time in ten months as a 70th-minute substitute for Ansu Fati in Barcelona's La Liga fixture against Villarreal on 27 September 2020. He scored his first goal in 380 days in the team's first Champions League fixture of the season against Ferencváros on 20 October.

He was also named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year for the first time, and was included in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year. On 31 May 2025, Dembélé won the Champions League after PSG beat Inter Milan 5–0 in the final, a match in which he provided two assists. After the final, his statistics for the season were of 33 goals and 15 assists in 49 appearances in all competitions, leading to him being cited as one of the leading candidates for the 2025 Ballon d'Or, which he ultimately won.

== International career ==

Dembélé was called up to the senior France squad for the first time in August 2016 to face Italy and Belarus in friendlies after Alexandre Lacazette and Nabil Fekir withdrew through injury. He made his debut on 1 September against the former at the Stadio San Nicola, replacing Antoine Griezmann for the final 27 minutes of a 3–1 win. On 13 June 2017, Dembélé scored his first goal for France in a 3–2 friendly victory against England.
On 17 May 2018, Dembélé was named in the 23-man French squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 15 July, he was an unused substitute as France beat Croatia 4–2 in the final.
Dembélé was called up to the French squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, where he played all games as France finished the tournament as runner-ups. Dembélé started the final but conceded a penalty in the first half and was substituted in the 41st minute.
On 18 November 2023, Dembélé scored a goal in a 14–0 win over Gibraltar during the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying, which was the largest win in the history of the France national team. At the final tournament in Germany, he was named man of the match in France's quarter-final victory against Portugal.


== Style of play ==
Dembélé is a winger who can play on either flank, due to his ability to use both feet, and to utilise his technical ability, speed, and agility in order to get past opponents or beat defenders in one-on-one situations. Dembélé can also operate as a left or right-sided attacking midfielder in a 4–4–2 or 3–5–2 formation. His clinical finishing and eye for goal also allow him to be deployed in a more offensive role as a striker. Dembélé also has great quality in terms of his shooting ability from distance.
Often described as one of the best players in the world, Dembélé has received praise from former team captain Andrés Iniesta for his game-changing qualities. He is well known for his ability to use either foot; a highly skilful player, his dribbling skills and ability to perform elaborate moves allow him to cut through from the left or right wing in order to score or create goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. The Frenchman is also an excellent crosser of the ball; moreover, his creativity is exceptional when in possession. Furthermore, his pace and intelligent runs make him a major offensive threat during counterattacks.


== Personal life ==
Dembele is a practising Muslim. 
He married a Moroccan woman in a traditional Moroccan ceremony in France in December 2021. They have a daughter, born September 2022. Dembélé's fatherhood has been credited with him settling down, as he was previously one of Barcelona's most-fined players due to disciplinary issues.
In July 2021, video footage of Dembélé along with teammate Antoine Griezmann circulated online, in which he was seen making racial comments against the Japanese technicians in their hotel room. As the technicians appeared to be troubleshooting the room's television, Dembélé made comments towards Griezmann in French, stating "All these ugly faces, just so you can play PES, aren't you ashamed?", continuing with "What the fuckin language?" before zooming in on one of the technicians' faces while laughing, mentioning "Are you technologically advanced in your country or not?".
