James (Leslie Cheung), Red Bean Pudding (Chow Yun-Fat) and Red Bean (Cherie Chung) are three orphans raised by crime lord Boss Chow (Kenneth Tsang), and grow up to become high-end art thieves. Boss Chow directs the three to steal a cursed painting located in France.  
After the heist in France goes awry, Red Bean Pudding is thought to be dead, and James and Red Bean start a relationship.

Chris Gould of DVDactive.com rated the film 5/10 and wrote that there was too much slapstick. J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it "an odd and annoyingly silly entry during [John Woo's] most creative period".
