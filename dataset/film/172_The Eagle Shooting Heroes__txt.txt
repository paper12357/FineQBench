The Eagle Shooting Heroes (Chinese: 射鵰英雄傳之東成西就) is a 1993 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Jeffrey Lau. It is a parody of Louis Cha's novel The Legend of the Condor Heroes, and a classic example of the mo lei tau comedy.

The film was a response to the over-budgeting of Wong Kar-wai's Ashes of Time. In order to cover up the cost of the yet unfinished film, the director decided to use many members of the cast to perform different roles and shoot a "quick-and-dirty" film for show during the Chinese New Year, a period for the Hong Kong film industry to harvest cash.
