== Early life ==
Murray was born on September 21, 1950, in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille, a mail room clerk, and Edward J. Murray, a lumber salesman. He attended Loyola Academy, an all-boys Jesuit school in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago.
Murray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors. A sister, Nancy, is an Adrian Dominican nun in Michigan; she has traveled the United States in two one-woman programs, portraying Catherine of Siena and Dorothy Stang. His brother Ed Murray died in 2020. Their father died in 1967 at the age of 46 from complications of diabetes when Bill was 17.
As a youth, Murray read children's biographies of American heroes like Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickok and Davy Crockett. He attended St. Joseph's grade school and Loyola Academy. During his teen years, he worked as a golf caddy to fund his education at the Jesuit high school, was the lead singer of a rock band (the Dutch Masters) and took part in high school and community theater. One of his sisters had polio and his mother suffered several miscarriages.
After graduating from Loyola Academy, Murray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, taking pre-medical courses, but quickly dropped out and returned to Illinois. In 2007, Regis awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. On September 21, 1970, his 20th birthday, the police arrested Murray at Chicago's O'Hare Airport for trying to smuggle 10 lb (4.5 kg) of cannabis, which he had allegedly intended to sell. It was discovered after Murray joked to the passenger next to him that he had packed a bomb in his luggage. Murray was convicted and sentenced to probation.


== Career ==


=== 1974–1979: Early work and Saturday Night Live ===
With an invitation from his older brother Brian, Murray got his start at Chicago's The Second City, an improvisational comedy troupe, studying under Del Close. In 1974, he moved to New York City and was recruited by John Belushi as a featured player on The National Lampoon Radio Hour.
In 1975, the Off-Broadway The National Lampoon Show led to his first television role as a cast member of the ABC variety show Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. That same season, another variety show, NBC's Saturday Night, premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season, canceled in early 1976. After working in Los Angeles with the "guerrilla video" commune TVTV on several projects, Murray rose to prominence in 1976. He officially joined the cast of NBC's Saturday Night Live for the show's second season, following the departure of Chevy Chase. Murray was with SNL for three seasons from 1977 to 1980. A Rutland Weekend Television sketch Monty Python's Eric Idle brought for his appearance on SNL developed into the mockumentary All You Need Is Cash (1978). Murray appeared as "Bill Murray the K", a send-up of New York radio host Murray the K, in a segment that parodies the Maysles Brothers's documentary The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit. During the first few seasons of SNL, Murray was in a romantic relationship with fellow cast member Gilda Radner. Murray landed his first starring role with Meatballs (1979).


=== 1980–1993: Work with Harold Ramis ===
In the early 1980s, he collaborated with writer-director Harold Ramis and starred in a string of box-office hits, including Caddyshack (1980) and Stripes (1981) and had a role in Tootsie (1982). He portrayed Hunter S. Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam (1980). Murray was the first guest on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman on February 1, 1982. He later appeared on the first episode of the Late Show with David Letterman on August 30, 1993, when the show moved to CBS. On January 31, 2012, 30 years after his first appearance with Letterman, Murray appeared again on his talk show. He appeared as Letterman's final guest when the host retired on May 20, 2015.
Murray began work on a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel The Razor's Edge. The film, which Murray co-wrote, was his first starring role in a drama. He later agreed with Columbia Pictures to star in Ghostbusters—in a role originally written for John Belushi—to get financing for The Razor's Edge. Ghostbusters became the highest-grossing film of 1984 and, at the time, the highest-grossing comedy ever. The Razor's Edge, which was filmed before Ghostbusters was released, was a box-office flop.
Disappointed over the failure of The Razor's Edge, Murray took a hiatus from acting for four years to study philosophy and history at Sorbonne University, frequent the Cinémathèque in Paris, and to spend time with his family in their Hudson River Valley home. During that time, his second son, Luke, was born. With the exception of a cameo in Little Shop of Horrors (1986), he made no film appearances, but participated in public readings in Manhattan organized by playwright-director Timothy Mayer and in a stage production of Bertolt Brecht's A Man's a Man. Murray returned to film with Scrooged (1988) and Ghostbusters II (1989).
Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-directed Quick Change (1990) with producer Howard Franklin. He co-starred in Frank Oz's What About Bob? (1991) alongside Richard Dreyfuss. He starred in Harold Ramis's fantasy comedy Groundhog Day (1993). The Washington Post's Hal Hinson praised Murray's performance: "Murray is a breed unto himself, a sort of gonzo minimalist. And he's never been funnier as a comedian or more in control as an actor than he is here. It's easily his best movie." That same year, he starred in the comedy Mad Dog and Glory alongside Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, "The great satisfaction of Mad Dog and Glory is watching Mr. De Niro and Mr. Murray play against type with such invigorating ease."


=== 1994–2009: Comedy stardom and mature roles ===

After the success of Groundhog Day, Murray appeared in a series of well-received supporting roles in films like Tim Burton's Ed Wood (1994) and Peter Farrelly's Kingpin (1996). Also in 1996, he appeared as himself in the Looney Tunes live action comedy Space Jam with Michael Jordan. However, his starring roles in Larger than Life (1996) and The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) were not as successful with critics or audiences. He received much critical praise for his role in Wes Anderson's coming of age comedy Rushmore (1998), opposite Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote, "Murray turns in a thrillingly knowing, unforced performance — an award-worthy high point in a career that continues". Murray received the Best Supporting Actor awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Billy Bob Thornton for A Simple Plan). Murray then took on more dramatic roles in Wild Things (1998) and Cradle Will Rock (1999). Murray decided to take a turn towards more dramatic roles and experienced a resurgence in his career. In 2000, he portrayed Polonius in Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, based on the play by William Shakespeare. The film starred Ethan Hawke in the title role, as well as Kyle MacLachlan, Julia Stiles, Liev Schreiber and Sam Shepard. The film received mixed reviews. Also in 2000, he portrayed Luther Billis in a concert version of the stage musical South Pacific at Lincoln Center. The following year, Murray reunited with Wes Anderson in the family comedy-drama The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) which starred Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anjelica Huston. In the film, Murray plays Raleigh St. Clair, the meek and mild-mannered neurologist, writer, and husband of Margot Tenenbaum (Paltrow).

In 2003, he starred in his first collaboration with director Sofia Coppola in Lost in Translation opposite Scarlett Johansson. Murray plays an aging movie star on assignment in Tokyo to shoot a Suntory whiskey commercial. Feeling isolated and alone he meets an American woman, Charlotte (Johansson) with whom he sparks an unlikely friendship. Coppola explores the themes of alienation and disconnection against a backdrop of cultural displacement in Japan. The independent drama was an immense critical success and commercial success. Roger Ebert hailed Murray's performance: "Bill Murray has never been better. He doesn't play 'Bill Murray' or any other conventional idea of a movie star, but invents Bob Harris from the inside out, as a man both happy and sad with his life – stuck, but resigned to being stuck." 
Murray earned numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and the Independent Spirit Award, as well as Best Actor awards from several film critic organizations. He was considered a favorite to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, but Sean Penn ultimately won the award for his performance in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River. In an interview included on the Lost in Translation DVD, Murray states that it is his favorite film in which he has appeared. He played himself "hiding out" in a local coffee shop in Jim Jarmusch's anthology film Coffee and Cigarettes (2003). He voiced Garfield in Garfield: The Movie (2004), which role he reprised in Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006). Murray later said that he only took the role because he was under the mistaken impression that the screenplay, co-written by Joel Cohen, was the work of Joel Coen.
He made his third collaboration with Anderson in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004), co-written by Anderson with Noah Baumbach. Murray plays Zissou, an oceanographer-filmmaker based on Jacques Cousteau who is struggling to finish his latest documentary and has to reconcile with his son (Owen Wilson). The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum and Michael Gambon. The film initially received mixed reviews, although Murray's performance was praised, and was a box office bomb. In the decades since, it has developed a cult following. The following year, Murray reunited with Jim Jarmusch in Broken Flowers (2005). The film revolves around Don Johnston (Murray), who embarks on a journey to four women (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton), to find out who sent him a mysterious letter. Roger Ebert praised Murray: "No actor is better than Bill Murray at doing nothing at all, and being fascinating while not doing it". He returned to the big screen for cameos in Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and Peter Segal's Get Smart (2008). He played an important role in the post-apocalyptic film City of Ember (2008). Murray starred in the independent film Get Low (2009) alongside Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek. The film is loosely based on a true story about a Tennessee hermit in the 1930s who throws his own funeral party while still alive. Murray and Duvall received critical praise and the film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Also in 2009, Murray played himself in the zombie comedy Zombieland starring Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg. Murray voiced Mr. Badger in Anderson's stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009).


=== 2010–2019 ===

Murray starred in Roger Michell's historical comedy Hyde Park on Hudson (2012), where he played Franklin D. Roosevelt opposite Laura Linney (Roosevelt's cousin Margaret Suckley) and Olivia Williams (Eleanor Roosevelt). The film focuses on the 1939 visit at the Roosevelts' Hyde Park home by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (Samuel West and Olivia Colman, respectively.) Murray received praise from critics; Roger Ebert wrote, "Bill Murray wouldn't be my first thought for an actor to play President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but he may have been the right choice...The role requires him to show Roosevelt as a sometimes lonely and sad man whose vacation getaway is his mother's family mansion, Springwood, near Hyde Park in upstate New York ... Murray, who has a wider range than we sometimes realize, finds the human core of this FDR and presents it tenderly." Murray received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination for his performance.

Since 2010, Murray has continued to appear in Wes Anderson films, including the coming of age comedy Moonrise Kingdom (2012) which also starred Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton. The film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or. The film was a box office and critical success. In 2016, the BBC included the film in its list of greatest films of the twenty-first century. Murray made a brief comic turn in Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). The film competed at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival where it received rapturous reviews. The film received 9 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, ultimately receiving 4, for Costume Design, Production Design, Makeup/Hair and Original Score. Murray, along with the cast, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for his ensemble work.
Murray, along with Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Jean Dujardin and Bob Balaban, starred in George Clooney's ensemble World War II drama The Monuments Men (2014). The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest box office success. Murray starred in the coming of age film St. Vincent (2014) alongside Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts. Murray played Vincent, a retired, grumpy, alcoholic Vietnam War veteran, and received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance. Peter Bradshaw's mixed review praised Murray: "[He] knows how to shine as the bleary, cynical companion to a younger person dragooned by fate into being both his pupil and his accomplice, and who puts Murray back in touch with his own innocence." He starred as a music manager in Barry Levinson's comedy film Rock the Kasbah (2015). Also that year, he starred in a Sofia Coppola-directed musical holiday special for Netflix called A Very Murray Christmas alongside Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Chris Rock, Michael Cera, Rashida Jones, George Clooney, and Miley Cyrus. It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. 

He voiced Baloo in Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book (2016). Murray received praise for his comic performance with Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly describing him at "his wry, what-me-worry comic-relief best". The film was an immense financial hit, and earned a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Murray was nominated for Favorite Animated Movie Voice at the People's Choice Awards; he lost to Ellen DeGeneres who reprised her role in Finding Dory (2016). There had been speculation that Murray might return to the Ghostbusters franchise for a rumored Ghostbusters 3. Murray once stated, "I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel," and also, "You know, maybe I should just do it. Maybe it'd be fun to do." Eventually, he appeared in both the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot as Martin Heiss, a cynical ghost debunker, which was released on July 15, 2016, and 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife.
In 2018, Murray returned to Saturday Night Live portraying Donald Trump's White House's Chief strategist Steve Bannon alongside Fred Armisen as journalist and author Michael Wolff. That year he was also part of Wes Anderson's ensemble cast of the animated film Isle of Dogs, which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. He also briefly reprised his role as himself in Zombieland: Double Tap (2018). Murray was part of the ensemble cast of Jim Jarmusch's zombie-comedy The Dead Don't Die (2019) alongside Adam Driver, and Selena Gomez.  The film received mixed reviews. However John Nungent of Empire praised its lead performances: "Murray and Driver are two of Jarmusch's favourite muses — the De Niro and DiCaprio to his Scorsese, if you like — and few actors capture that lackadaisical sense of humour quite as well as them, both faces almost Buster Keaton-esque in their deadpan resolve."


=== 2020–present ===

Murray reprised his role in Groundhog Day for an ad which aired during the 2020 Super Bowl. In it, he steals the groundhog and drives him to various places in the orange Jeep Gladiator. Murray reunited with Sofia Coppola for the comedy-drama On the Rocks (2020) opposite Rashida Jones. The film premiered at the 58th New York Film Festival where it received positive reviews, with many critics praising Murray's performance.

== Other ventures ==

Murray is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant with two locations. In 2001, they opened a location at the World Golf Village near St. Augustine, Florida. The second location opened in 2018, inside the Crowne Plaza Rosemont Hotel near the O'Hare International Airport. In 1978, Murray appeared in two at-bats for the Grays Harbor Loggers Minor League Baseball team, credited with one hit and a lifetime batting average of .500.
He founded and was part-owner of the St. Paul Saints, a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. Bill occasionally traveled to Saint Paul, Minnesota to watch the team's games. Murray sold his interest in the Saints in 2023. As part of the Goldklang Group, he owns or owned part of the Charleston RiverDogs, the Hudson Valley Renegades, and the Brockton Rox. He has invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the Utica Blue Sox, the Fort Myers Miracle, the Salt Lake Sting (APSL), the Catskill Cougars, and the Salt Lake City Trappers.

In 2022, Murray recited poetry and sang with the cellist Jan Vogler, in a recorded production of New Worlds: The Cradle of Civilization, which was released in cinemas.


== Public image ==
Murray's popularity has been such that he holds an iconic status in American popular culture. Murray's eccentric style of comedy, both on-screen and in his personal life, has caused him to be seen as a folk hero to many making him a significant meme in various media including books and the Internet. In 2016 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center. Roger Ebert writes that "The Murray persona has become familiar without becoming tiring: The world is too much with him, he is a little smarter than everyone else, he has a detached melancholy, he is deeply suspicious of joy, he sees sincerity as a weapon that can be used against him, and yet he conceals emotional needs. He is Hamlet in a sitcom world." Whilst declaring him an ideal Beckettian actor, perfectly suited for Waiting for Godot, theatre scholar Octavian Saiu - who hosted a special dialogue with Murray and Peter Bradshaw in 2025 - spoke about Murray's incredible ability to not only make people around him look good, but to “bring out the light in them”.


== Personal life ==

Being very detached from the Hollywood scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has reportedly prevented him from participating in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, "It's not that hard. If you have a good script, that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem."
Murray has homes in Los Angeles; Rancho Santa Fe, California; Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina; and Palisades, New York. Between 2008 and 2013, Murray maintained a residence in the Lower Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village.
In 2007, Murray was pulled over by Swedish police on suspicion of driving a golf cart under the influence of alcohol.
Murray has experienced symptoms of depression. He has claimed that art and music have helped ease past depressive episodes.
He is a student of the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff.
Murray is the godfather to Wes Anderson's daughter, Freya.


=== Marriages and children ===
During the filming of Stripes, Murray married Margaret Kelly on January 25, 1981. Later, they remarried in Chicago for their families. Margaret gave birth to two sons, including Luke. Following Murray's affair with Jennifer Butler, the couple divorced in 1996. 
In 1997, he married Butler. Together, they have four sons. Butler filed for divorce on May 12, 2008, accusing Murray of domestic violence, infidelity, and addictions to sex, marijuana, and alcohol. Their divorce was finalized on June 13, 2008. 
Butler died on January 19, 2021.


=== Chicago sports and other activities ===

Murray is a fan of several Chicago professional sports teams, especially the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and Chicago Bulls. He was a guest color commentator for the Cubs' April 17, 1987 game against the Montreal Expos. He was in attendance, along with fellow Cubs fans John Cusack, Eddie Vedder, and Bonnie Hunt, during the Cubs' historic Game Seven victory during the 2016 World Series. Murray is an avid Quinnipiac University basketball fan, where his son served as head of basketball operations, and he is a regular fixture at home games. He cheered courtside for the Illinois Fighting Illini's game against the 2004–2005 Arizona Wildcats in the Regional Final game in Chicago. He is a fixture at home games of those teams when in his native Chicago. After traveling to Florida during the Cubs' playoff run to help "inspire" the team (Murray joked with Cubs slugger Aramis Ramírez he was very ill and needed two home runs to give him the hope to live), he was invited to the champagne party in the Cubs' clubhouse when the team clinched the NL Central in late September 2007, along with fellow actors John Cusack, Bernie Mac, James Belushi, and former Cubs player Ron Santo. Murray appears in Santo's documentary, This Old Cub. In 2006, Murray became the sixth recipient of Baseball Reliquary's annual Hilda Award, established in 2001 "to recognize distinguished service to the game by a fan". He sang "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during a 2016 World Series game at Wrigley Field.
As a Chicago native, Murray appeared at the 50th annual Chicago Air & Water Show in August 2008. He performed a tandem jump with the U.S. Army Parachute Team Golden Knights. He was the MC for Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival on July 28, 2007, where he dressed in various guises of Clapton as he appeared through the years. He served as MC again in 2010 and once more in 2019.
Murray's son, Luke, is an assistant coach for the UConn Huskies men's basketball team. Murray has attended several of their games, such as during their championship run in the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.


=== Feuds and misconduct allegation ===
Murray has been known for his mood swings, leading Dan Aykroyd to refer to him as "The Murricane". Murray has said of his reputation: "I remember a friend said to me a while back: 'You have a reputation.' And I said: 'What?' And he said: 'Yeah, you have a reputation of being difficult to work with.' But I only got that reputation from people I didn't like working with, or people who didn't know how to work, or what work is. Jim, Wes and Sofia, they know what it is to work, and they understand how you're supposed to treat people." In the book Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, Chevy Chase recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an SNL broadcast in 1978, in which Chase had returned to guest host. Murray later said of the incident, "It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It's all fine." The two went on to star together in Caddyshack, which was shot the following year.
Over his career, Murray has gotten into combative disagreements and feuds with several actors including Sean Young, Nick Nolte, Seth Green, Rob Schneider, Geena Davis, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Richard Dreyfuss, as well as with film director McG, and producer Laura Ziskin. 
Murray has said in interviews that he and film director Richard Donner did not get along well while filming Scrooged. Donner said of Murray: "He's superbly creative, but occasionally difficult – as difficult as any actor." Murray also had a falling out with film director and longtime collaborator Harold Ramis during the production of Groundhog Day. According to screenwriter Danny Rubin, "They were like two brothers who weren't getting along." They had creative differences which ultimately ended their fruitful film collaboration in 1993. Murray eventually reconciled with Ramis just before his death in February 2014 and honored him at the 86th Academy Awards. Lost in Translation director Sofia Coppola said that Scarlett Johansson and Murray did not get along during filming but despite this, she's stated that he was a lot of fun to work with on the production. Johansson elaborated saying that Murray was in a "hard place" and that they have reconciled."
In April 2022, production of Being Mortal was suspended after Murray was accused of unspecified "inappropriate behavior" with the woman receiving a private settlement of $100,000 from Murray. In 2025, Murray elaborated what happened saying, "I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask ... (It was) something that I had done to someone else before. I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it was funny ... (I don't) go too many days or weeks without thinking of what happened in Being Mortal." Murray has been defended by longtime collaborator Wes Anderson amid the misconduct claims. Johansson also defended him saying that his experiences during COVID-19 and the misconduct allegation have both "changed" and "humbled him" and that "[they] have led up to him being held accountable for that kind of behavior".


=== Religious beliefs ===
Murray stated in a 1984 interview: "I'm definitely a religious person, but it doesn't have much to do with Catholicism anymore. I don't think about Catholicism as much." 
In a 2014 interview, Murray expressed affection for the Traditional Latin Mass and expressed concerns about some of the changes within the Mass of Paul VI: "I'm not sure all those changes were right. I tend to disagree with what they call the new Mass. I think we lost something by losing the Latin. Now if you go to a Catholic Mass even just in Harlem it can be in Spanish, it can be in Ethiopian, it can be in any number of languages. The shape of it, the pictures, are the same but the words aren't the same."


=== Political views ===
Murray donated $1,000 to former Governor of Nebraska Bob Kerrey's successful election to the United States Senate in 1988. 
During the 2000 presidential campaign, Murray supported Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. 
In a 2018 interview, Murray sarcastically praised the Trump tax cuts, opining them to be a "great thing for the corporations".


=== Philanthropy ===
In 1987, he donated money to help build the Nathalie Salmon House, which provides affordable housing for low-income seniors. Michael and Lilo Salmon, the founders of Housing Opportunities and Maintenance for the Elderly (HOME), said Murray performed "miracles" for them.
