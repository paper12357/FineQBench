== Early life ==
Potter was born Ryan Kenichi Hagimoto in Portland, Oregon on September 12, 1995. His father, Keiji Hagimoto, is Japanese, while his mother, Jordanna Alex Potter-Lew, is an American, of paternal English, German, and Swedish descent, and maternal Russian-Jewish and Ukrainian-Jewish ancestry. Shortly after his birth, Potter’s family returned to Tokyo, Japan, where he was raised, until returning to the United States with his mother just before his 7th birthday. He was then raised by his single mother and changed his name to her maiden name. 
In 2014, his mother remarried to Chinese-American martial artist and Hollywood stuntman James Lew, making Potter his stepson. Potter's first language was Japanese; however, he is no longer fluent. 
At the age of eight, he began studying White Tiger kung fu, a discipline which he would continue to pursue throughout his teenage years. Other childhood interests reportedly included baseball, skateboarding, and playing the drums.


== Career ==
In 2010, Potter began his acting career at the age of 13 when he received a leaflet in his kung fu class announcing Nickelodeon was looking for teenagers to star in a new martial-arts themed program entitled Supah Ninjas. After a few days of considering an acting career, Potter decided to audition, eventually landing the series' lead role of Mike Fukanaga, a typical American teen who discovers that he is descended from a long line of ninjas. In March 2012, Nickelodeon announced it had renewed Supah Ninjas for a second season.
Following the premiere of Supah Ninjas in January 2011, he became one of Nickelodeon's popular young stars, featured in numerous teen magazines and making personal appearances in the network's special Nickelodeon's Worldwide Day of Play and its reboot of Figure It Out, as well as an appearance on its sister network's broadcast of the 2011 TeenNick HALO Awards. In March 2012, Potter began a recurring role on Fred: The Show, portraying Fred's best friend.
Potter later voiced Big Hero 6 protagonist Hiro Hamada and reprised his role in the animated series based on the film and Kingdom Hearts III. The film would later go on to win "Best Animated Feature" at the 2015 87th Academy Awards.
Potter was also lobbying for the role of Tim Drake and created a concept fight scene using the character's signature bō staff as an audition. He ended the video with a challenge to Ben Affleck to cast him as Robin. He was then cast as Beast Boy in the DC Universe / HBO Max series Titans.
From 2020 to 2022, he voiced the character Kenji Kon in Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous on Netflix.
In 2024, Potter was announced to be starring in a fan film based on the Warner Bros. animated series Batman Beyond titled "Batman Beyond: Year One"; with Potter set to play the lead role of Terry McGinnis / Batman.


== Advocacy ==
In 2011, Potter founded the organization Toy Box of Hope, a charity which holds an annual holiday collection drive for children in homeless shelters and transitional living facilities in the Los Angeles area. During the second annual event in 2012, Potter spoke of the focus of the organization, stating "[W]hat we want to do is provide bedsheets, jackets and toys to [homeless shelters], so these kids are like, 'Wow, someone cares, there's hope.'" In 2012, Potter was reportedly planning to expand Toy Box of Hope to include a "Birthday Party Box" program.
In June 2012, Potter became one of the youngest celebrities to lend his voice to California's No H8 Campaign in support of same-sex marriage. When explaining his involvement, 16-year-old Potter stated, "I know what it feels like to be bullied. And I will not tolerate the thought of anyone, for any reason, being bullied. It starts with young people, and it can end with young people. As we learn to embrace our diversity, we become stronger, more tolerant. The differences are beautiful. The differences matter. It's what makes life an adventure."
