== Early life and education ==
Molina was born in Yuba City, California to a Mexican family, and raised in Grass Valley. He graduated from Bear River High School in 2003, to subsequently attend and graduate from the California Institute of the Arts in 2007.


== Career ==
Molina joined Pixar in 2007. He started as a 2D animator on Ratatouille. He later moved on to be a storyboard artist, working on Toy Story 3 and Monsters University. Molina also illustrated the Little Golden Book for Toy Story 3. After getting an additional screenplay material credit for both Monsters University and The Good Dinosaur, Molina started his first assignment as a screenwriter, for Coco, and later went on to co-direct the film. He also wrote several lyrics for the film.
In 2022, he served as an associate executive producer on the Academy Award-nominated Turning Red.
Following the success of Coco and the D23 Expo announcement in September 2022, Molina was announced to direct the 2025 film Elio. However in August 2024, it was announced that Molina had left the project, with Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi taking over the storywriting and directorial duties instead. Nevertheless, he retained his director credit on the film due to his heavy amount of work that he made. Reports in June 2025 suggested Molina left after studio demands for edits to remove LGBT-related content from the film.
In March 2025, during the Disney Shareholder Meeting, CEO Bob Iger announced that the sequel to Coco was in early development, with Molina returning from the original film.
