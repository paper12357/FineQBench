== Early life and education ==

== Career ==


=== Fight Club ===
Uhls's breakthrough came when he was hired to adapt Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club for the screen. The adaptation process was extensive; Uhls worked closely with Fincher for over a year to translate the novel's complex, non-linear narrative and internal monologue into a workable script. One of the most significant changes from the novel was the introduction of a new, more cinematic ending, a decision made with the blessing of Palahniuk. Upon its release, Fight Club was met with a polarized critical reception but has since become a widely acclaimed cult classic.


=== Later work ===
Following the success of Fight Club, Uhls co-wrote the screenplay for the science fiction action film Jumper (2008), directed by Doug Liman and starring Hayden Christensen. Uhls also developed, wrote, and executive produced Semper Fi, a drama series for Fox.
Uhls has also been attached to several high-profile projects, including an adaptation of the pulp novel series The Destroyer for director Shane Black and Sony Pictures.


=== Teaching ===
In addition to his screenwriting work, Uhls frequently serves as a guest lecturer and instructor. He has taught at his alma mater, UCLA, as well as for the Austin Film Festival.
