In 2018, Ando received high praise for her performance as Nobuyo Shibata in director Hirokazu Kore-eda's Shoplifters, being called "fantastic" and "the stand-out", with film critic Simon Abrams stating that "Kore-eda gave Andô her character's (strictly metaphorical) dance steps, but she realizes and owns every maneuver she was asked to (and then some).... No small feat... given how subtly complicated her dance steps are."
