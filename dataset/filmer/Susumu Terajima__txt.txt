Susumu Terajima (寺島 進, Terajima Susumu; born 12 November 1963) is a Japanese actor.  Though he has played a wide range of characters, he is perhaps best known for his portrayal of yakuza figures, most notably in the films of Takeshi Kitano.
Terajima made his acting debut in 1986's A Homansu.  He joined Japan Music Entertainment in December 2018.


== Early life ==
Terajima was born in Fukagawa, downtown of Tokyo. He is the second son of three and his father was a tatami craftsman. His childhood memory was when he and his mother walking to kindergarten together and his teacher called him "mu-chan" because of his cute face. Terajima's interest in acting began when he watched an action-comedy movie, Truck Yarou. He also loved to sing, impersonating members of the pop duo Pink Lady with his friends.
After graduating from high school, to pursue his dream of becoming an actor, he enrolled at Mifune Art Academy to continue his education, although his parents did not agree with his decision as they wanted him to continue working in the family business. During those years, Terajima did many side jobs, including work as a stuntman, until he met Yusaku Matsuda, who directed A Homansu and gave Terajima a minor role in the movie.


== Career ==
Terajima played a supporting role in Violent Cop (1989), where he met his respectful mentor, Takeshi Kitano. His breakthrough as an actor was in Kitano's Sonatine. After the success of Sonatine, Terajima went on to enjoy a successful career playing various roles in television and film, usually in a supporting position, but occasionally as the lead character, such as in Hirokazu Kore-eda's After Life and Sabu's The Blessing Bell (2002).
