== Early life ==
Wilson was born in Dallas, the middle child of three sons of photographer Laura Cunningham Wilson (b. 1939) and Robert Andrew Wilson (1941–2017), an advertising executive and operator of a public television station. His brothers Andrew and Luke are also actors. Wilson's parents are of Irish descent. As a teenager, Wilson broke his nose twice: the first time in a high school fight, and the second time playing football with friends. “You know, probably my nose wouldn’t have been that great even if it hadn’t been broken," Wilson told The Los Angeles Times. 
After getting expelled for cheating in geometry, he attended New Mexico Military Institute. He later attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, but did not graduate. While in college, he met and was roommates with Wes Anderson, who became a director and frequent collaborator.


== Career ==

Wilson made his film debut acting in the Wes Anderson short film Bottle Rocket (1994), which was later expanded into the feature-length film Bottle Rocket (1996). Wilson co-wrote the screenplay with Anderson, and acted opposite his brother Luke Wilson. David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, saying, "A marvelous debut film for its director, writer and lead actors, Bottle Rocket is propelled by a fresh approach to the caper genre". That same year, he had a supporting role in the black comedy The Cable Guy (1996), starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ben Stiller, an early admirer of Bottle Rocket. Wilson played Leslie Mann's date in the film. In 1997, he had a role in the adventure thriller Anaconda and executive produced the James L. Brooks comedy As Good as It Gets.
In 1998, Wilson had roles in the science fiction disaster film Armageddon and the independent drama film Permanent Midnight. 
He also reunited with Anderson, co-writing the script for his next two films, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, which Anderson directed. The pair garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for 'Tenenbaums'. Wilson did not act in Rushmore, but was shown briefly in a photograph in the film. After appearing in supporting roles in 1999, he acted in horror film The Haunting, and The Minus Man. His future girlfriend, singer Sheryl Crow, was a co-star in the latter film.


=== 2000–2006: Film stardom ===

The film earned the writing team an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
