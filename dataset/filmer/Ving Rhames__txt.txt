== Early life and education ==
Rhames was born and raised in Harlem, New York City, the son of Reather, a religious stay-at-home mom raising him and his brother Junior, and Ernest Rhames, an auto mechanic whose parents were South Carolina sharecroppers. He was named "Irving" after NBC journalist Irving R. Levine.
Unlike many of his childhood friends, Rhames neither took drugs nor succumbed to easy street money, but rather played football for Covent Avenue Baptist Church in the Hamilton Heights Historic District. One of Rhames' junior high school teachers praised his poetry reading. On a whim, he applied to New York's High School of Performing Arts, where he developed his love of acting. After high school, he studied drama at SUNY Purchase, where fellow acting student Stanley Tucci gave him his nickname "Ving". Rhames later transferred to the Juilliard School's Drama Division (Group 12: 1979–1983) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1983, and began acting in Shakespeare in the Park the following Monday.


== Career ==


=== Stage ===
Rhames' training in the classics gained him roles as early as 1983 at Shakespeare in the Park in Richard III. He has also appeared in the classics Richard II, and Sophocles' play Ajax, as well as off-Broadway productions such as Map of the World and Ascension Day, and regionally in plays by Henrik Ibsen and Molière.

In an interview, Rhames commented about screen versus stage roles, "I don't give Hollywood the power to limit me," and "I can always do theater, I can do Ibsen, I can do Macbeth, I can do Chekhov, I can do Molière, Othello, I can do Richard III."

At the ceremony he gave his award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon, saying, "I feel that being an artist is about giving, and I'd like to give this to you." Lemmon was clearly touched by the gesture as was the celebrity audience who gave Lemmon a standing ovation. Lemmon, who tried unsuccessfully to give the award back to Rhames, said it was "one of the nicest, sweetest moments I've ever known in my life." The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced later that they would have a duplicate award prepared for Rhames. That moment was #98 on E!'s 101 Awesome Moments in Entertainment. The New York Times lauded Rhames for the act, writing that in doing so he "demonstrated his capacity for abundant generosity".
