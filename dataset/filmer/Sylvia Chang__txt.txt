Sylvia Chang (born 21 July 1953) is a Taiwanese actress, singer, director, screenwriter, and producer.


== Early life ==
Chang was born in Chiayi, Taiwan. She dropped out of school when she was 16 and started her career as a radio DJ. When she was 18 years old she acted in her first film.


== Career ==
Chang acted in her first film, The Tattooed Dragon (龍虎金剛) (1973), at the age of 18. Chang often attempted to do her own stunts in the four-part film series Aces Go Places.
She stated in an interview with film editor Clarence Tsui, "I still think Hong Kong's film industry is male-dominated". She also believes that "There aren't many male filmmakers who would write scripts for women". She helped write the script for Run Papa Run, based on the novel by Benny Li Shuan Yan, that follows a man who belongs to the Triad and the relationships he has with his mother, wife, and daughter. Chang said, "I thought why don't I explore the gentler side of men".
Chang first began performing in theatre productions more than 30 years ago. She returned to the stage in the production of Design For Living (華麗上班族之生活與生存) that premiered in November 2008 and went on into 2009.  Chang stated in an interview, "The reason for me to take on a stage play again after 20 years is because I was lured by the director, he has invited handsome guys like Zheng Yuan Chang [sic] and David Huang into the play". Critics have remarked on the versatility in her roles along with her willingness to always try for something new.
Chang is also a singer and her music has become popular in karaoke, where her song "The Cost of Love" is commonly sung.
In the 1980s, the second film Chang directed, Passion, which she wrote and also starred in, won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress. She has stated, "I never went to any school as a director or a filmmaker, so all my film education actually was from the set".
For a time, Chang was the head producer of New Cinema City in Taiwan, but she left a few years after joining.  For 20 30 40, she not only played the 40-year-old woman protagonist but also wrote and directed it.
In 1992, she served as a jury member at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival.
In August 2010, Chang joined the board of the Hong Kong International Film Festival Society as its vice-chair.
In June 2018, she was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In the same year, she served as a jury member at the 75th Venice International Film Festival. 


=== Critical reception ===
Chang once said of her films that "I've always felt that animation or special effects shouldn't just be limited to science-fiction films and their ilk. Dramas can also play around with them". One critic wrote of her: "In an industry that kisses young actresses with celebrity, then swallows them and spits them out, Chang has a sequoia's longevity. She is the only Hong Kong actress of her generation -— the early '70s —-to keep starring in movies".
Chang's films have been selected to screen at the BFI London Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, Busan International Film Festival, and Tokyo Filmex. She has served as a jury member at the Berlin International Film Festival, as well as the Venice Film Festival. She also holds the record for the most nominations for the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress, with ten nominations and two wins.
At the 49th Toronto International Film Festival, Chang received an honourable mention from the Platform Prize jury for her performance in the film Daughter's Daughter—the first time in the history of the award that the Platform jury has recognized an individual performer. The film also earned Chang a nomination for Best Leading Actress at the 61st Golden Horse Awards.


== Personal life ==
Chang married Hong Kong-based journalist Bob Liu in 1979. They divorced in 1984. Chang married Taiwanese businessman Billy Wang Jing-xiong in 1991, and they have one son, Oscar. She also has two stepsons.
In July 2000, Chang's nine-year-old son Oscar was kidnapped and held for a ransom of HK $15 million. The police found him after a few days, safe, and arrested the kidnappers. Chang stated, "With your life, you have to move on, there's no other choice; so, out of no choice, then, it's a matter of your attitude".

Chang is an advocate and a "life-long volunteer" for World Vision International, the humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organization. She created an advertisement, sponsored by World Vision, to promote the company World Vision Advertisement on YouTube.
