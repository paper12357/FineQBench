== Early life ==
Tang Wei was born on 7 October 1979 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. She is the only child of Tang Yuming, a painter, and Shi Xifeng, who works as a Yue opera actress. From 1992 to 1994, Tang attended school in Shenzhen, Guangdong due to her father's job. She graduated from a vocational school in Hangzhou, where she studied fine arts, in 1996 and worked as a model afterward. 
Initially aspiring to study acting at the Central Academy of Drama, she failed three times before being admitted to the directing program in 2000 on her fourth attempt. At university, she caught the attention of producer Yuan Hong and Taiwanese stage director Stan Lai, leading her to be cast in a production of the latter's play A Dream Like a Dream, a role she held until she was cast for the film Lust, Caution in 2006.

=== 2004–2009: Lust, Caution and ban ===
In 2004, Tang starred in a TV series, Policewoman Swallow (2004), and a stage play, Che Guevara. She also appeared in TV dramas Sons and Daughters of the Red Cross (2004), Leaving Seafront Street (2005), East Meets West (2005), Born in the 60s (2006) and Silent Tears (2006).In July 2006, Tang was cast from more than 10,000 actresses to star in Ang Lee's classic film Lust, Caution (2007), adapted from Eileen Chang's novella inspired by the story of female spy Zheng Pingru. Tang learned Shanghainese and Suzhou Pingtan, which is sung in the Suzhou dialect, for her role. She won the Golden Horse Award for Best New Performer and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award and a BAFTA Award for the film.
Despite the critical acclaim for her performance, China's State Administration of Radio Film and Television (SARFT) ordered a media ban on Tang because of the sexual nature of her performance. All print ads and feature content using Tang were removed, and her endorsements were discontinued. In August 2008, Tang obtained Hong Kong citizenship through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, which was expected to enable her to work in a relatively censorship-free market. She, however, was replaced by Maggie Q in Tian Zhuangzhuang's big-budget period film The Warrior and the Wolf (2009). In February 2009, during her absence from the show business, Tang briefly attended drama classes at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom.


=== 2010–2012: Return to the screen ===
In 2009, Bill Kong, head of Edko Films and executive producer of Lust, Caution, gave Tang a chance to relaunch herself with the Hong Kong romantic comedy Crossing Hennessy (2010), directed by Ivy Ho. For her role, Tang honed her Cantonese, which she had picked up during her school days in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Crossing Hennessy is the first film starring Tang to be shown in China since Lust, Caution, marking the lift of the ban. She was nominated for the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress and Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress for this film.

From November 2009 to March 2010, Tang filmed alongside Hyun Bin in Late Autumn (2010), directed by Kim Tae-yong. The film was shot in Seattle, Washington. Tang's performance won over South Korean audiences and made her the only non-Korean to win the Baeksang Awards for Best Actress.
In September 2010, it was announced that she was to appear in the CCP tribute film The Founding of a Party, playing the role of Tao Yi, an early girlfriend of Mao Zedong. However, her scenes were cut out in the theatrical version, allegedly at the request of Mao Zedong's grandson, Mao Xinyu. In December 2011, she dubbed the character of Pia Sahastrabuddhe, originally portrayed by Kareena Kapoor, in the Chinese version of the Bollywood film 3 Idiots (2009).
Tang returned to mainstream cinema with two major films; Speed Angels, a car-racing flick directed by Jingle Ma, and Dragon, a martial arts epic directed by Peter Chan.
