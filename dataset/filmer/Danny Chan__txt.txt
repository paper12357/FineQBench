Danny Chan Pak-Keung (Chinese: 陳百強; 7 September 1958 – 25 October 1993) was a Hong Kong singer, songwriter and actor. One of the first Cantopop idols in Hong Kong, he gained fame alongside performers Alan Tam, Anita Mui, and Leslie Cheung, who were collectively known as "Three Kings and a Queen" (三王一后) or "Tam Cheung Mui Chan" (譚張梅陳) in the 1980s. He is best remembered for such songs as "Waiting" (等), "Life Expectation" (一生何求), "Ripples" (漣漪), "Loving You Alone" (偏偏喜歡你) and "Cherish Tonight" (今宵多珍重).


== Early life and career ==
Chan was born on 7 September 1958 at Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam (薄扶林). His father, Chan Pang-Fee (Chinese: 陳鵬飛; 1923 – 5 April 2019), a businessman in the watch industry, was fond of Cantonese opera and became one of his son's musical influences.
During his childhood, Chan developed a passion for music and mostly learnt to play organ keyboard and piano by himself. He was an alumnus of St. Paul's Co-educational College and also a classmate of lyricist Andrew Lam Man Chung (林敏驄). 
Chan won third prize at the TVB "Hong Kong Pop Song Writing Invitation" in 1977 with his self-written English song "The Rocky Road". In 1978, he won first prize at the Hong Kong Yamaha Electone Festival by playing the theme music of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. This earned him his singing contract with Hong Kong Television Broadcasts (TVB) and officially launched his entertainment career. In that same year, he made his acting debut with HK TVB through a TV drama called Sweet Babe (甜姐兒). 
Chan's musical talent attracted the attention of artist manager Tam Kwok-Gei (譚國基). Tam signed Chan under his artist management agency, Hollywood Casting Agency (HCA), and subsequently had Chan sign a recording contract with EMI. Chan's first music album, First Love, was released in 1979. His self-composed song on the album, "Tears for You" (眼淚為你流), was an instant hit. 
Chan subsequently signed music contracts with Hong Kong EMI (1979), WEA (1980), DMI (1986), and finally moved back to WEA (1989). His Cantopop romance ballads achieved high levels of public success and critical acclaim, some of which are still popular such as "Waiting" (等), "Life Expectation" (一生何求), "Ripples" (漣漪), "Loving You Alone" (偏偏喜歡你), "Cherish Tonight" (今宵多珍重), "Deeply in Love with You" (深愛著你), "Having You" (有了你), "Misty Rain" (煙雨悽迷), "Applause" (喝采), and "Minutes' Date" (幾分鐘的約會).  The song "Remembrance on Parents' Love" (念親恩) is often played on radio stations and frequently chosen for karaoke. 
Chan's first five albums were produced by Tam Kwok-Gei, and the song concepts were mostly targeted towards youth. Chan composed a large quantity of songs during this period. From the sixth album, Pouring Out My Heart (傾訴), onward, Chan started to produce albums himself. He reached his first peak in his musical career with this album and the next one, Loving You Alone (偏偏喜歡你), where the album sales achieved five platinum certifications (250,000 copies) in Hong Kong.
In 1984, he sang an English duet "Tell Me What Can I Do" with American country music singer Crystal Gayle. It was produced in the US and released in both the US and Japan, but was largely unknown due to lack of promotional budget. Meanwhile, he also covered Jim Capaldi's ballad "Warm" with an improved music arrangement.
In the early 1980s, Chan was a host in the TV show Bang Bang Sound (Bang Bang咁嘅聲). His co-operation with Leslie Cheung and Paul Chung in the films Encore (1980) (喝采) and On Trial (1981) (失業生), received positive reception from the public and media. He is the main character in HK TVB TV series Breakthrough (1982) (突破) together with his favourite female partner Mary Jean Reimer (翁靜晶). His sole comedy film Merry Christmas (1984) (聖誕快樂) was a huge box office success. He is also one of the main characters in one of Hong Kong's the most famous romantic film from the 1980s, An Autumn's Tale (1987) (秋天的童話), as Vincent (Jennifer's ex-boyfriend), with Chow Yun-fat (as Samuel Pang) and Cherie Chung (as Jennifer).
During the span of his musical career, Chan held many music concerts in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, Canada and the United States. He held his first major local concert at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in July 1982 (2 nights), and another concert in the newly developed Hong Kong Stadium in September 1983 (2 nights), both of which were organised by Brainchild Productions (富才制作). From this time on, all of his major concerts were held in Hong Kong Stadium. His avant-garde concept January 1985 concerts (3 nights) were organised by Capitol Artists Entertainment (華星娛樂), but was met with underwhelming feedback. Warm critical acclaims was received in the Dickson Entertainment (迪生娛樂) organised concerts in December 1986 (2 nights) and April 1988 (4 nights). His 10th anniversary concerts in September/October 1989 (6 nights), and the purple themed concerts in March 1991 (3 nights) were organised by Yiu Wing Entertainment (耀榮娛樂).
Chan also participated and represented Hong Kong in various music festivals, such as the World Popular Song Festival 1984 in Tokyo, the Nagasaki Asia Music Festival 1988 in Japan, Peace Music Concert 1988 in Singapore, Tokyo Music Festival 1989 and the Shanghai Music Festival Warner Music Special Concert 1991. He was also invited to perform at the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympic Games opening ceremony. In 1986, he performed in the presence of The Royal Thai princess in a Thai charity show.
In 1991, Chan announced his decision to leave the Hong Kong music industry. He had planned to hold several farewell concerts in the US, Canada and Hong Kong, but his sudden descent into a coma in May 1992 halted such plans.


== Death ==
Chan suffered from mild depression, which worsened during the late 1980s. 
On 18 May 1992, Chan was found unconscious and he was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. Chan had suffered from advanced brain damage. It was speculated that this was due to drug use. He went into a coma for almost a year and a half and died on 25 October 1993 at the age of 35. He was buried at Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.


== Legacy ==

On 26 October 1993, the day after Chan's passing, Commercial Radio organized a 90-minute memorial concert at Queen Elizabeth Stadium. Those who attended the video concert included Kenny Bee, Elisa Chan, Liu Fong, Sam Tsang, Yu Sin-man, and members of the pop music group City Beat. Sounds of weeping were heard throughout the performance, with the venue at some moments falling completely silent. During the concert, Kenny Bee stated: "We have lost one of our best musicians. It is a show for Danny; but, he could not turn up tonight... I hope he could still feel our love."
On 22 October 1995, Chan's father, Chan Pang-Fee, sponsored and built the Danny Commemoration Pavilion (陳百強紀念館) in his ancestoral hometown Sijiu Town, Taishan City, Guangdong Province, China (中國廣東省台山市四九鎮). 
On 8 November 2005, the Hong Kong Post issued a set of special stamps featuring "Hong Kong Pop Singers". This stamp set honoured five Hong Kong pop stars who have left their mark on Cantopop music history, with Chan being featured on the HK$1.80 stamp.
