== Career ==


=== 1980s ===
Cusack began acting in films in the early 1980s. In 1980 he appeared in a 16mm educational film short about teen problem solving titled “Why Is It Always Me?”. His first on-screen theatrical film appearances were in minor roles, Class (1983) and John Hughes' directorial debut film Sixteen Candles (1984). On the set of Grandview, U.S.A. (1984), his co-star Jamie Lee Curtis gifted Cusack with his first car, a 1974 Chevrolet Impala, which she had named 'La Bamba'. 16-year-old Cusack made his breakthrough performance in Rob Reiner's teen comedy The Sure Thing (1985). It was a critical success, but has since become an underrated film.
He then took on the small-town teen dark comedy film Better Off Dead (1985). Cusack was initially embarrassed and disappointed by the film, describing it as the "worst thing he had ever seen" on his first watch. The film had a budget of $3 million and grossed $10.3 million at the box office, but the studio still considered it a failure. Cusack also worked with the director Savage Steve Holland on One Crazy Summer (1986).
Cusack then had a brief appearance in Reiner's Stand by Me (1986), a film based on Stephen King's The Body. On the film, co-star Kiefer Sutherland recalled, "John Cusack was on the film for at least a week. I admired what he was doing and thought he was an actor I wanted to emulate." In 1988, Cusack went on and starred in the independent film Eight Men Out (1988), about Major League Baseball's Black Sox Scandal during the 1919 World Series. He also appeared in the cult comedy Tapeheads (1988), a film by executive producer Michael Nesmith.
In the late 1980s, Cusack starred in Cameron Crowe's directorial debut film, Say Anything... (1989). He starred opposite actress Ione Skye. Cusack was reluctant to do the film at first, but he gave his character dimension through referencing the punk bands The Clash and The Replacements. In the film, Cusack became known for the boombox scene, in which his character, Lloyd Dobler, stands near his girlfriend Diane's bedroom window, and wordlessly holds up a cassette player above his head, blasting Peter Gabriel's 1986 song "In Your Eyes". His character has since become influential in popular culture, such as the band Lloyd Dobler Effect, and Frank Iero's band Pencey Prep with their misspelled song "Lloyd Dobbler".


=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Cusack played a con artist in Stephen Frears' 1990 neo-noir film The Grifters.

Daniels later said, "I love working with John Cusack. He's terrifying, he's electrifying, and he inspires me to be a better director. He's a fiery, intense presence on set.

== Political views ==

Cusack is anti-war, having tweeted, "Being anti-war — is pro-troops — pro-human". Cusack endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark in the 2004 presidential election. Between 2005 and 2009, Cusack wrote blogs for The Huffington Post, which included an interview with Naomi Klein. He voiced his opposition to the war in Iraq and the George W. Bush administration, calling the government's worldview "depressing, corrupt, unlawful, and tragically absurd". He also appeared in a June 2008 MoveOn.org advertisement, where he said that George W. Bush and John McCain had the same governing priorities.
Cusack criticized the Obama administration for its drone policy in the Middle East and its support of the National Defense Authorization Act, and became one of the initial supporters of the Freedom of the Press Foundation in 2012. In June 2015, he stated in an interview with The Daily Beast that "when you talk about drones, the American Empire, the NSA, civil liberties, attacks on journalism and whistleblowers, [Obama] is as bad or worse than Bush". He later criticized the publication for misquoting him in order to make an interesting headline.
At a Moscow hotel room in 2015, Cusack, Daniel Ellsberg, and Arundhati Roy met Edward Snowden, who had fled the US because of his leaks of classified information surrounding illegal population surveillance. This meeting was converted into a book co-authored with Roy titled Things That Can and Cannot Be Said.
Cusack endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 and 2020 presidential bids. He is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
During May 2020, Cusack was recording a George Floyd protest in Chicago on social media when he was attacked by police with batons and later pepper-sprayed.

I would love to think about other things—poetry, love, anything else. But that’s just not the times we’re in. And, y’know, not all anger is just sort of somebody stuck in some rut in a basement. If you can’t be outraged on behalf of other people, or express anger at injustice, maybe that is its own rut. Sure, I might go too far sometimes. But I really just want to get across the message: that we’re sleepwalking into an incredibly dark possible future. Maybe being outspoken hurts your career… I’m just aware it helps me sleep better at night, knowing that I wasn’t passive during this time.
Cusack has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, calling him "an evil fuck who grinds our faces in it every day". During the 2020 presidential election, he pledged on social media that he would vote to "kick Trump's loathsome Nazi ass out of the White House and into prison".
On March 19, 2025, Cusack joined the "#TeslaTakedown Mass Mobilizing Call", a remote protest targeting Tesla, Inc. and its CEO, Elon Musk, for his role in the Trump administration, especially his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). During the call, Cusack said, "Like Trump, Musk is a pathological liar. He’s a criminal. He’s a sociopath and a ghoul."


=== Israel–Palestine ===

Cusack has been fiercely critical of Israel's military actions against Palestinians. He criticized Israel's killing of Palestinians in the 2014 Gaza War, and retweeted articles supporting Gaza for weeks. In 2018, Cusack signed an open letter in support of Lorde cancelling performances in Israel, which was in response to a request from the BDS movement.
In June 2019, Cusack tweeted out an image of a large fist with a blue Star of David crushing a small crowd of people next to a quote by neo-Nazi Kevin Alfred Strom often misattributed to Voltaire: "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize". In the tweet, Cusack added the words "Follow the money." He said that the tweet was meant to criticize Israel's policies against Palestinians, but nonetheless deleted the tweet and apologized, saying that "antisemitism has no place in any rational political dialogue".
Following the 2023 October 7 attacks and the subsequent Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Cusack signed another open letter (Artists4Ceasefire) urging Joe Biden to "call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay..." He also blocked and direct messaged pro-Israel and Zionist Twitter users' insults, and asserted that Israel is conducting a genocide in Gaza.
On July 7, 2025, Cusack posted a meme on social media website Bluesky linking former United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to Cusack being accused of antisemitism. Cusack later deleted the post within two hours after posting it.
