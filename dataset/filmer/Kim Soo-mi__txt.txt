Kim Soo-mi (Korean: 김수미; born Kim Young-ok (김영옥); October 24, 1949 – October 25, 2024) was a South Korean actress who had a prolific career in film and television.


== Career ==
She debuted in a talent contest in 1970, then shot to fame in Country Diaries. The landmark TV series aired for almost 20 years, making her one of the most popular Korean actresses of the 1980s.
In 2003 she made a memorable cameo as a profanity-spouting ajumma in the Jang Na-ra comedy Oh! Happy Day. It successfully revamped her image and rejuvenated her fading career. She quickly became known in the Korean entertainment industry as the "Queen of Ad-lib," with her comic talent showcased in many of her succeeding projects, notably Mapado, Twilight Gangsters, Granny's Got Talent (2015), and the Marrying the Mafia sequels.
Kim also gained attention for her turns in more serious fare, such as 2006's Barefoot Ki-bong, a heartwarming pic about a developmentally disabled man. Her 2011 film Late Blossom is a romance between two elderly couples, a topic rarely explored in Korean cinema. The low-budget indie became a sleeper hit, and for her portrayal of an Alzheimer's-afflicted woman, she won Best Supporting Actress at the Blue Dragon Film Awards.


== Personal life ==
In 1998, Kim's chauffeur-driven BMW shot backward, killing her mother-in-law. She filed a ₩1 billion lawsuit against BMW, alleging that the sudden unintended acceleration had been a car defect. The Seoul District Court ruled in BMW's favor in 2003, as it was unclear whether the accident was caused by driver error or a sudden start. She appealed to the Seoul High Court.
Kim headed publicity for the 1999 Hanam International Environment Expo. From 2003 until her death in 2024, she chaired of the Department of Theater and Film at Soongsil University's College of Social Sciences.


== Illness and death ==
In May and July 2024, Kim suffered health issues due to fatigue. On October 25, her son discovered her in an unconscious state and rushed her to Seoul St. Mary's Hospital's emergency department, where she died of a cardiac arrest from hyperglycemic shock, at the age of 75. Her wake and funeral were held at Hanyang University Hospital in Seongdong District, Seoul. Her remains were cremated on October 27.
