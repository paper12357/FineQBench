Originally called the Bystanders, the group included guitarist and co-writer Rod Castro, Alan Muffterson, Tyrone Tomke, and Michael Taylor.


== Personal life ==

Sizemore married actress Maeve Quinlan in 1996. They divorced in 1999 because of Sizemore's drug problems. He dated Heidi Fleiss, known as the onetime "Hollywood Madam". Sizemore had two twin sons from a previous relationship, born in 2005.
On October 19, 2005, Vivid Entertainment released The Tom Sizemore Sex Scandal, a pornographic video featuring Sizemore and three women. In the video, Sizemore claimed to have had sex with Paris Hilton. Hilton denied his claim and said it was a ploy by Sizemore to increase sales of the video.


=== Substance abuse and legal issues ===
Sizemore said that he battled drug addiction from age 15.
In 2003, Sizemore was convicted of domestic violence against ex-girlfriend Heidi Fleiss. On March 25, 2005, he was sentenced to seven months in jail and four months of drug treatment for repeatedly failing drug tests while on probation. He was caught attempting to fake a urine test using a Whizzinator. Fleiss' restraining order against him lapsed by 2010. 
On May 8, 2007, while still on probation for a previous drug conviction, he was arrested outside the Four Points Sheraton hotel in Bakersfield, California, for possession of methamphetamine.
In 2010, Sizemore appeared as a patient/castmember on VH1's third season of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. Because Fleiss was also in treatment on the show that season, both she and Sizemore had to consent to appear together. His reunion with Fleiss was amicable. 
In 2013, he appeared on the episode "Explosive Relationships" of the talk show Dr. Phil in which he discussed his rise to stardom and the subsequent fallout after his years of struggling with substance abuse. Also in 2013, Sizemore claimed in an interview that he had begun to achieve sobriety after a stern interrogation from fellow actor Robert De Niro. De Niro personally checked Sizemore into rehabilitation.
In early 2014, a recording emerged of Sizemore alleging that former girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley had an affair with Bill Clinton in 1998. Under threat of legal action, Sizemore admitted that the allegation was false. He elaborated that the recording was made without his knowledge during a time when he was battling substance abuse. 
In February 2017, he pleaded no contest to two charges of domestic abuse for assaulting his girlfriend. He was sentenced to 36 months of summary probation, 30 days of community service and a year-long domestic violence program. He was subject to two protective orders associated with the charges and ordered to pay various fees. The deal was made by Sizemore to avoid spending 210 days in jail.
In November 2017, it was revealed by The Hollywood Reporter that Sizemore had been kicked off the set of the film Born Killers (then known as Piggy Banks) in 2003 for allegedly sexually molesting an 11-year-old actress when the film was in production near Salt Lake City, Utah. He denied any wrongdoing and was allowed back on the film set after the Salt Lake County prosecutor's office decided against going forward with the case "due to witness and evidence problems." In May 2018 the actress, by then 26 years old, filed a lawsuit against Sizemore, claiming that his alleged abuse caused longstanding emotional problems and seeking at least $3 million. A statement from Sizemore's publicist again denied the abuse, noting that nothing amiss was reported by a Born Killers staff member whose duty was supervising the child actors who were on the set. On August 27, 2020, USA Today reported that a Utah judge had dismissed the lawsuit. Sizemore again denied her claims saying: "Beyond the loss of work and the pain and humiliation this has caused me and my family, the thought that an 11-year old girl would think I violated her, whether it be because she misconstrued some inadvertent touching when the director placed her upon my lap for the photo shoot or someone else instilled this idea in her head for whatever malicious, self-serving reasons, is what devastates me most."
On January 5, 2019, Sizemore was arrested for misdemeanor drug possession of "various illegal narcotics" in Burbank, California.


== Death ==
On February 18, 2023, Sizemore suffered a brain aneurysm at his Los Angeles home and was hospitalized at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in critical condition. On February 27, his representative issued a statement indicating that doctors had determined that there was "no further hope" for Sizemore to recover and had "recommended end-of-life decisions" to his family. Sizemore died on March 3, 2023, at the age of 61.
