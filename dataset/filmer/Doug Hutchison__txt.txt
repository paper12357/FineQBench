== Personal life ==
On May 20, 2011, Hutchison married his third spouse, Courtney Stodden, in Las Vegas. They met when Stodden, whom Hutchinson initially believed to be "well into her twenties", attended an acting class taught by Hutchison. Their relationship drew controversy and criticism, as Stodden was 16 years old when the couple married, and Hutchison was 51. It was legal at that time to marry a 16 year old in Nevada with parental consent and has changed since late 2019. According to Hutchison, his agent quit, his family disowned him, he received death threats, and he was labeled a "pedophile" and other ageist insults, as a result of the marriage. Hutchison had some defenders: Stodden's mother, Krista Keller, who praised him for the kindness and love with which he treated Stodden, and Dr. Jenn Berman, a therapist who worked with the couple during their appearance on Couples Therapy.
In October 2012, the couple appeared as one of the celebrity couples in the second season of the VH1 reality television series Couples Therapy, which depicts celebrity couples undergoing counseling for relationship problems. According to Stodden, the couple enrolled in therapy in order to resolve issues that arose in their marriage from their age difference. On November 1, 2013, the media reported that Stodden and Hutchison were ending their marriage of two and a half years and filing for divorce. In August 2014, the pair announced that they had reconciled. 
In May 2016, it was announced that the couple was expecting their first child. In July 2016, around three months into their pregnancy, Stodden suffered a miscarriage. On May 20, 2016, Hutchison and Stodden celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary by renewing their vows.
In January 2017, it was reported that Stodden and Hutchison had separated, but were still living together at the time. In March 2018, Stodden filed for divorce, which was finalized in March 2020. 
On April 8, 2018, Hutchison announced via the Erick & Deer the Goat YouTube channel that he returned to Detroit to find Erick Brown, who travels the country with a therapy goat to spread peace, and that he fully supports Brown's initiative, the Rock Club Foundation.


=== Grooming allegations ===
In 2021, Stodden publicly stated that their marriage was a result of Hutchison's grooming, which allegedly started with him reaching out via email. Hutchison stated in a 2011 interview that Stodden contacted him via email first under their mother's supervision, as confirmed by Courtney themself back then.
