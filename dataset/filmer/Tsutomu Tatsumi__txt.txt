Tsutomu Tatsumi (Japanese: 辰巳努; born March 1972) is a former actor from Kansai, Japan. His agency at the time was Actor Pro.


== Biography ==
He was active as a child actor mainly in the 1980s, and received high acclaim for his roles as Takayuki Yoshizawa (Dankichi) in the movie Setouchi Boys Baseball Team and the main character's childhood in My Lovely Days. He gained attention for voicing the main character Seita in Grave of the Fireflies.
In 2012, when an event was held to commemorate the Blu-ray release of Grave of the Fireflies, the organizers made every effort to ask Tatsumi to perform, but had to give up as they were unable to find Tatsumi. As the event was being broadcast live on the web, people were encouraged to come to the venue if they were watching, but this did not happen.
He was 16 years old when he voiced Seita in Grave of the Fireflies. This is because Seita's set age is 14 years old, which is close to Tatsumi's age at the time of his appearance, and the story is set in his hometown of Kansai, and the director, Isao Takahata, chose actors from Kansai. This may also be due to the fact that he aspired to such things. Additionally, he later said, "It's easier to empathize with someone when they're close in age", and this was also the case with Ayano Shiraishi, who played Setsuko.
The movie pamphlet says, "If only I had been more talkative, I think my life would have been easier", and "If I had been more honest about my mistakes, I would have been able to live a successful life." "I don't think I want to live like Seita," he said when it was first aired on Friday Road Show.
