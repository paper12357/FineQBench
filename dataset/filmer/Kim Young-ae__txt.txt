Kim Young-ae (Korean: 김영애; 21 April 1951 – 9 April 2017) was a South Korean actress.


== Career ==
Kim Young-ae began her acting career when she joined MBC's 3rd Open Recruitment  in 1971. She made her acting debut in the TV police procedural Chief Inspector and subsequently built a prolific career in film and television.
After she made her film debut in 1973's Long Live the Island Frogs, Kim became most active on the big screen in the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing in films such as Wang Sib Ri, My Hometown (also known as Wangsimni or A Bygone Romance, 1976), Suddenly at Midnight (1981), and Diary of King Yeonsan (1987).
As she grew older, Kim transitioned to more television work. Among her notable television dramas are Queen Min (1973), Ilchul (or Sunrise, 1989), Magpie-in-law (1991), The Brothers' River (1996), Waves (1999), Go, Mom, Go! (2003), Hwang Jini (2006), Royal Family (2011), and Moon Embracing the Sun (2012).
In 2009, she drew praise for her portrayal of a terminally ill yet headstrong mother who has a love-hate relationship with her daughter in the dramedy film Aeja (internationally known as Goodbye Mom). Another notable role was as a Busan restaurant owner whose son is arrested and tortured during the 1980s in The Attorney (2013). Kim later won Best Supporting Actress at the Grand Bell Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards for her performances.


== Other activities ==
In 2006, Kim temporarily put her acting career on hold when she became the vice chairman of cosmetics firm Chamtowon, which mainly produces soap and mud packs. Her company filed a ₩20 billion lawsuit against state-owned network KBS in 2008, after the program Consumer Report falsely reported that Chamtowon's mud-based products contained heavy metals above safe levels. During the eight months after the broadcast, the company went virtually bankrupt, and had to suspend operations at its factory in Jeongeup in North Jeolla Province and lay off 100 workers. After the Korea Food and Drug Administration confirmed that the magnetic substance found in the mud products was oxidized steel originally present in the mud, not foreign materials put in the products during the manufacturing process, the court ruled in favor of Chamtowon, and ordered KBS to release a correction regarding the wrong report. But Chamtowon wasn't able to recover from its financial losses, and the strain contributed to Kim's divorce from her husband.


== Death ==
Kim died of pancreatic cancer on April 9, 2017, just two weeks before her 66th birthday.
