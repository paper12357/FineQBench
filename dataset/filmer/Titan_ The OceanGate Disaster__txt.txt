Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, "Gripping to a point if arguably a bit overlong, it has the grim suspense of similar nonfiction catastrophe accounts, like National Geographic's Tham Luang cave flooding film The Rescue without the inspirational angle — or, needless to say, the rescue."
Matt Goldberg of TheWrap wrote that the film "fails to discover the depths of the issues that led to the fateful implosion of the submersible that claimed five lives in Summer 2023, placing sole focus on Stockton Rush's misdeeds."
