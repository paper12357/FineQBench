== Life and career ==
Krizan was featured in Linklater's Slacker (1990) and Waking Life (2001). She played the high school teacher Ginny Stroud in Dazed and Confused (1993). Krizan also acted and wrote her monologue in Waking Life.
In October 2012, Publishers Weekly spotlighted Krizan's self-publishing efforts on Kickstarter for her debut non-fiction book Original Sins: Trade Secrets of the Femme Fatale. The Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in November 2012.
In 2013, Krizan published an article in the HuffPost revealing she had found a previously unpublished love letter Gore Vidal wrote to the diarist Anaïs Nin. This letter contradicts Vidal's previous characterization of his relationship with Nin, showing that Vidal did have feelings for her that he denied in his autobiography, Palimpsest. Krizan did this research in the runup to the release of the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, Mirages, to which she wrote the foreword.
In 2019, Krizan published Spy in the House of Anaïs Nin, an examination of long-buried letters, papers, and original manuscripts Krizan found while doing archival work in Nin's Los Angeles home.
In 2021, Krizan brought her writing class online with the debut of "The Magic Hour with Kim Krizan", hosted on Patreon.
