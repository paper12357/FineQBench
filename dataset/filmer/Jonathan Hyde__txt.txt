Jonathan Stephen Geoffrey King (born 21 May 1948), known professionally as Jonathan Hyde, is a British-Australian actor. Hyde is perhaps best known for roles as Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury in the comedy film Richie Rich (1994), Samuel Parrish and Van Pelt in the fantasy adventure film Jumanji (1995), J. Bruce Ismay in the epic romantic film Titanic (1997), Culverton Smith in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, Warren Westridge in creature feature film Anaconda (1997), Dr. Allen Chamberlain in the adventure horror film The Mummy (1999), and Eldritch Palmer in the FX TV series The Strain. Although an Australian citizen, he has mostly lived in the United Kingdom since 1969, after his family left Australia.


== Early life ==
Hyde was born in Brisbane, Queensland, to a middle-class family. Hyde's interest in law took him to university to study the subject but his passion for performing and the theatre led him to pursue a career in acting. Leaving for London in 1969, he was awarded a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and won the Bancroft Gold Medal for excellence in his graduating year of 1972. In a 2007 interview with The Age, Hyde said he did not make a conscious decision to lose his Australian accent after moving to Britain, and that it still "comes and goes."


== Career ==
Hyde is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Among other roles, he played Ferdinand in a 1985 production of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. He was an original cast member of Not the Nine O'Clock News, the first series of which was pulled from broadcast because of the General Election of 1979. The 1990s produced many of Hyde's best known film roles such as Cadbury, the loyal butler in Richie Rich, Sam Parrish/Van Pelt, the hunter in Jumanji, J. Bruce Ismay, the arrogant managing director of the White Star Line in Titanic, and Egyptologist Allen Chamberlain in The Mummy. He has been in numerous films including The Contract, The Curse of King Tut's Tomb, Land of the Blind, The Tailor of Panama, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking, Eisenstein and Anaconda.

Both plays toured together internationally, before taking up residence in the New London Theatre. The final performance was on 12 January 2008. He reprised his role of Kent in the 2008 television film of King Lear.
In the final series of BBC's popular series Spooks, Hyde played Ilya Gavrik, a Russian Minister.
