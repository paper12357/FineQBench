After releasing a couple of albums with some success (she won the TVB Jade Solid Gold (1993)'s Gold Award of "The Best New Female Singer"), she made her feature-film debut in Wong Kar-wai’s arthouse martial arts film Ashes of Time alongside superstars such as Leslie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Brigitte Lin.
In 1994, she made her first collaboration with director Tsui Hark in the film The Lovers (梁祝). Yeung was cast as the female lead, Zhu Yingtai opposite Nicky Wu's Liang Shanbo.
