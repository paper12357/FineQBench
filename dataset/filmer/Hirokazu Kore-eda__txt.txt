For Like Father, Like Son (2013) and Shoplifters (2018), he won the Cannes Film Festival's Jury Prize and Palme d'Or, respectively. Shoplifters was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Kore-eda has since directed Broker (2022) and Monster (2023).


== Early life and education ==
Kore-eda's father was born in Taiwan. Kore-eda's paternal grandparents could not marry under Japanese law at the time as they had the same last name, so they had eloped to Taiwan, then under Japanese colonial rule, where they could marry. Kore-eda has cited this as a reason for his affinity toward Taiwan.
Kore-eda's father was conscripted into the Japanese military during World War II and detained in Siberia for three years after the end of the war.
Hirokazu Kore-eda was born on 6 June 1962 in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan. He is the youngest of three children. From an early age, Kore-eda watched movies with his mother. He said through an interpreter, "My mother loved films! She adored Ingrid Bergman, Joan Fontaine, Vivien Leigh! We couldn't afford to go together to the cinema, but she was always watching their movies on TV. She stopped all family business or discussions to watch these movies. We would watch together. So I adored film—like her."
After seeing Japan win the gold medal in men's volleyball at the 1972 Munich Olympics, he started playing in middle school. He rose to team captain in high school as a setter.
He initially failed his entrance exams, but was accepted into Waseda University a year later. He graduated from Waseda University's Graduate School of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1987.


== Career ==
Before becoming a director, Kore-eda worked as an assistant director on television documentaries. He directed his first television documentary, Lessons from a Calf, in 1991. He directed several other documentary films thereafter.
Kore-eda's 1994 documentary August without Him depicts his friendship with AIDS sufferer Hirata Yutaka. It follows Kore-eda as he meets Yutaka and films his life between 1992 and 1994. The first Japanese to admit he contracted the disease via homosexual contact, Yutaka speaks openly about his condition. The film ends with his condition having deteriorated. Yutaka died of AIDS complications on May 29, 1994.
At the 1995 Venice Film Festival, Kore-eda's first fiction feature film, Maborosi, won a Golden Osella for Best Cinematography. At the first Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema in 1999, he won awards for Best Film and Best Screenplay for his film After Life.

In November 2022, Kore-eda disclosed that he had completed shooting his next Japanese film, Monster. With post-production underway, Monster was scheduled for release in Japan on 2 June 2023.

=== Style and influences ===
According to the Harvard Film Archive, Kore-eda's works "reflect the contemplative style and pacing of such luminaries as Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang". Kore-eda is often compared to Yasujirō Ozu, but has said he feels more influenced by Ken Loach and Mikio Naruse.
In a 2009 interview, Kore-eda said that Still Walking is based on his own family.
