== Early life and education ==
Burns was born in 1962 in Golden Valley, Minnesota. In 1985, Burns graduated summa cum laude with a degree in English from the University of Minnesota.


== Career ==
After graduating from the University of Minnesota, Burns began his career in advertising, later becoming a television commercials director. He was part of the team at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners that created the original Got Milk? campaign.
Burns has written screenplays for The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Informant! (2009), and Contagion (2011), all of which feature Matt Damon. His films The Informant! (2009), Contagion (2011), and Side Effects (2013) were directed by Steven Soderbergh. He also wrote a screenplay for The Man from U.N.C.L.E, to be directed by Soderbergh.  Burns also produced the Academy Award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006). He wrote and directed the film The Report (2019), a drama about the secret torture program inside the CIA. He performed uncredited rewrites on Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the Star Wars film Rogue One and the James Bond film No Time to Die (2021).
Burns also wrote a screenplay for a Star Wars film set after Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker, entitled The Hunt for Ben Solo (and operating under the code name Quiet Leaves), directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Adam Driver as Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. While Lucasfilm loved the idea, when they presented the screenplay to Disney, Bob Iger and Alan Bergman said no because, according to Driver, "They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that." Still Burns received a reportedly seven figure payment for the script.
Public interest in Burns's film Contagion (2011) renewed during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the seventh-most downloaded film on iTunes by March 6, 2020.
In a March 2020 interview, Burns commented on the film's resurgence and similarities to the active pandemic, especially in the wake of a round of CDC budget cuts:

"I was terrified. Every scientist who I spoke to when I worked on the movie said that exact same thing to me: It's not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when.' You can decide that most of the time, firemen are just sitting around. But it's very hard to start a fire department once your house is on fire. And so the notion that we're going to cut these things and we'll just try to rebuild them when we need them is foolish and dangerous. I was very aware that our Department of Homeland Security had a pandemic team standing by because this is a real threat. The fact that this administration decided to do away with that puts all of us at risk."Burns was announced to write the screenplay for a new adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho, with Luca Guadagnino directing and Lionsgate distributing.
