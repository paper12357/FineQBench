== Early life ==
Cotillard was born on 30 September 1975 in Paris, and grew up in Alfortville, in the southern suburbs of Paris, where she lived with her family in a flat on the 18th floor of a tower block until she was 11 years old, when her family moved to the small commune of Aulnay-la-Rivière in the Loiret department in north-central France. She grew up in an artistically inclined household. Her mother, Niseema Theillaud, is an actress and drama teacher. Her father, Jean-Claude Cotillard, is an actor, teacher, former mime (appearing in French in Action), and theatre director, of Breton descent. She has two younger twin brothers, Quentin and Guillaume, a writer and a sculptor. The family later moved to La Beauce, a town near Orléans, where her father set up his own theatre company.
Cotillard's father introduced her to cinema, and as a child she would mimic Louise Brooks and Greta Garbo in her own bedroom. She began acting during her childhood, appearing in one of her father's plays. At the age of 3, she appeared on stage for the first time opposite her mother. At the age of 15, Cotillard entered the Conservatoire d'art dramatique in Orléans. She graduated in 1994 and then moved to Paris to pursue an acting career. In order to pay her bills in her teens, she started making key-chains at home, and sold them at candy stores.
Cotillard speaks French and English fluently. She learned English at the age of 11. She started learning Spanish at school but then abandoned it. Years later, she began studying the language again after watching Lovers of the Arctic Circle (1998) by Julio Medem, which is one of her favorite films. She also started learning Danish because she wanted to work with director Thomas Vinterberg after watching his 1998 film The Celebration, but that did not work out.


== Career ==


=== 1982–1999: Early roles and breakthrough ===
In 1982, at the age of 6, Cotillard made her on-screen debut in the short film Le monde des tout-petits, directed by Claude Cailloux and broadcast by the French TV channel TF1. The following year, she appeared in another short film for TF1, Lucie, also directed by Cailloux. In 1991, she appeared in a TV spot against alcoholism titled "Tu t'es vu quand t'as bu?" ("You've seen yourself when you're drunk?"), launched by the French Committee for Health Education.

After small appearances and performances in theatre, Cotillard had occasional, minor roles in television series such as Highlander in 1993, where she had her first English-speaking role aged 17. Her career as a film actress began in the mid-1990s, with minor roles in Philippe Harel's The Story of a Boy Who Wanted to Be Kissed (1994), which was her feature film debut at the age of 18, and in Arnaud Desplechin's My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument, and Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte, both released in 1996. Also in 1996, she had her first leading role in the television film Chloé, directed by Dennis Berry and opposite Anna Karina, with Cotillard starring as a teenage runaway who is forced into prostitution. 
In 1998, she appeared in Gérard Pirès' action comedy Taxi, playing Lilly Bertineau, the girlfriend of delivery boy Daniel, played by Samy Naceri. The film was a box office hit in France with over 6 millions tickets sold, and Cotillard was nominated for a César Award for Most Promising Actress. She reprised the role in Taxi 2 (2000) and Taxi 3 (2003). In 1999, Cotillard ventured into science fiction with Alexandre Aja's post-apocalyptic romantic drama Furia. That same year, she also starred in Francis Reusser's Swiss war drama film War in the Highlands (La Guerre dans le Haut Pays), for which she won the Best Actress Award at the 1999 Autrans Mountain Film Festival.
In 2001, she appeared in Pierre Grimblat's romantic war drama film Lisa, playing the title role and younger version of Jeanne Moreau's character, alongside Benoît Magimel and Sagamore Stévenin. She also starred in Gilles Paquet-Brenner's drama film Pretty Things (Les Jolies Choses), adapted from the work of feminist writer Virginie Despentes, portraying twins of completely opposite characters, Lucie and Marie, for which she earned a second César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress. In 2002, Cotillard starred in Guillaume Nicloux's thriller A Private Affair (Une Affaire Privée), in which she portrayed the mysterious Clarisse.


=== 2000–2009: Transition to Hollywood and acclaim ===
Cotillard started the transition into Hollywood when she obtained a supporting role in Tim Burton's 2003 fantasy comedy-drama film Big Fish, in which she played Joséphine, the French wife of Billy Crudup's character, William Bloom. The production, her first English-language film, allowed her to work with well-established actors such as Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange and Allison Lohman. Big Fish was a critical and commercial success, and marked a turn for Cotillard, who was unhappy with her career in France at the time for not getting good roles, and considered taking some time off until she got the role in Big Fish. She next starred in Yann Samuell's 2003 French romantic comedy film Love Me If You Dare (Jeux d'enfants), as Sophie Kowalsky, the daughter of Polish immigrants who lives in France and begins playing a game of dares with her childhood friend, portrayed by Guillaume Canet. The film was a box office hit in France with over 1 million tickets sold.
In 2004, she won the Chopard Trophy of Female Revelation at the Cannes Film Festival, narrated the children's audio book Cinq Contes Musicaux Pour les Petits ("Five Musical Tales For the Little Ones") by Isabelle Aboulker, and had supporting roles in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement (Un Long Dimanche de Fiançailles), as the vengeful prostitute Tina Lombardi, a femme fatale who goes on a killing spree to avenge her lover's death, for which she won a César Award for Best Supporting Actress, and in Lucile Hadžihalilović's mystery thriller Innocence as the ballet teacher Mademoiselle Éva; both films were acclaimed by critics. In 2005, Cotillard starred in six films: Steve Suissa's Cavalcade, Abel Ferrara's Mary, Richard Berry's The Black Box (La Boîte Noire); Rémi Bezançon's Love Is in the Air (Ma vie en l'air), Fabienne Godet's Burnt Out (Sauf le respect que je vous dois), and Stéphan Guérin-Tillié's Edy. In May 2005, Cotillard portrayed Joan of Arc for the first time in the Orléans Symphonic Orchestra's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake at the Palais des Sports d'Orléans, in Orléans, France. She reprised the role several times when performing the oratorio in different countries in the following years.
In 2006, the actress took on significant roles in four feature films, including Ridley Scott's romantic dramedy A Good Year, in which she had her major English-language role up to that point, Fanny Chenal, a French café owner in a small Provençal town, opposite Russell Crowe as a Londoner who inherits a local property. She played Nadine in the Belgian comedy Dikkenek, alongside Mélanie Laurent, and the role of Nicole in Fair Play. She also played Léna in the satirical coming-of-age film Toi et moi, directed by Julie Lopes-Curval, for which she learned how to play the cello for her role.

Cotillard was chosen by director Olivier Dahan to star as French singer Édith Piaf in his biographical film La Vie en Rose before he had even met the actress, after he noticed a similarity between Piaf's and Cotillard's eyes. It was dubbed "the most awaited film of 2007" in France, where some critics said Cotillard had reincarnated Édith Piaf to sing one last time on stage. During the film's premiere at the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival, Cotillard was in attendance and received a 15-minute standing ovation. Hollywood talent agent Hylda Queally signed Cotillard shortly after the premiere at the festival. La Vie en Rose was a box office hit in France, with more than 5 million admissions, and made US$86 million worldwide on a US$25 million budget. Cotillard became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for a non-English language performance since 1972 (when Liv Ullmann won for The Emigrants), and also the first person to win a Golden Globe for a (Comedy or Musical) non-English language performance. On 10 February 2008, Cotillard became the first French actress since Stéphane Audran in 1973 to be awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. At the Academy Awards, she won Best Actress, becoming the first woman and second person (after Adrien Brody in The Pianist six years earlier) to win both a César and an Oscar for the same performance. Cotillard is the second French actress to win this award, and the third overall to win an Oscar, after Simone Signoret in 1960 and Juliette Binoche in 1997. She is the first Best Actress Oscar winner for a non-English language performance since Sophia Loren in 1961. She is also the first and (as of 2024) only winner of an Academy Award for a French-language performance. On 23 June 2008, Cotillard was one of 105 individuals invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Following her Oscar win, Cotillard continued her Hollywood career and starred alongside Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the role of Billie Frechette in Michael Mann's Public Enemies, released in the United States on 1 July  2009. Later that year, she appeared in Rob Marshall's film adaptation of Nine, the musical based on the 1963 Federico Fellini film 8½. As Luisa Contini, the wife of Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis), Cotillard performed two musical numbers: "My Husband Makes Movies" and "Take It All". Time magazine ranked her performance in Nine as the fifth best female performance of 2009, behind Mo'Nique, Carey Mulligan, Saoirse Ronan and Meryl Streep. She won the Desert Palm Achievement Actress Award at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival – her second prize from the festival – and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her work in Nine. Cotillard appeared on the cover of the November 2009 issue of Vogue with her Nine co-stars, and on the magazine's July 2010 cover by herself.

She played Mal Cobb, a projection of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)'s deceased wife, in Christopher Nolan's film Inception, released on 16 July 2010. Nolan described Mal as "the essence of the femme fatale", and DiCaprio praised Cotillard, saying "she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character." The film made US$825 million in worldwide box-office receipts, and Cotillard and DiCaprio's pairing in Inception ranked eighth on the Forbes list of "Hollywood's Top Earning On-Screen Couples". That same year, she also starred as Marie, an environmentalist, in Guillaume Canet's drama Little White Lies (Les petits mouchoirs).
In 2011, Cotillard co-starred in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris as Pablo Picasso's fictionalised mistress, Adriana, with whom Owen Wilson's character, Gil, falls in love.

That same year, she also appeared alongside Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon in Steven Soderbergh's thriller Contagion; and had the top rank on Le Figaro's 2011 list of the highest-paid French actors of 2010, the first time in nine years that a female had topped the list.

The film premiered in the main competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening. Cotillard received rave reviews for her performance, and Cate Blanchett wrote an op-ed for Variety describing the film as "simply astonishing" and stating that "Marion has created a character of nobility and candour, seamlessly melding herself into a world we could not have known without her. Her performance is as unexpected and as unsentimental and raw as the film itself." She earned a fifth César Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a third Golden Globe nomination (her first for Best Actress – Drama), and her second Critics' Choice Award and Lumière Award nominations. James Kaelan of MovieMaker magazine wrote that it was a travesty that Cotillard was not nominated for an Academy Award for Rust and Bone. Cotillard also received several other honours and career tributes in 2012, at the Telluride Film Festival, Hollywood Film Festival, AFI Fest, Gotham Awards, and Harper's Bazaar Awards.
In 2013, Cotillard was named Woman of the Year by Harvard's student society Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and Le Figaro also ranked her the second highest-paid actress in France in 2012 and the seventh highest-paid actor overall.

James Gray wrote the script especially for Cotillard after meeting her at a French restaurant with her boyfriend. Cotillard had to learn 20 pages of Polish dialogue for her role, and Gray stated that she is the best actor he's ever worked with. Her performance was widely acclaimed, and she was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the National Society of Film Critics Award, the Toronto Film Critics Association Award and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress in 2015. She starred in Guillaume Canet's Blood Ties in 2013 with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup and her Rust and Bone co-star Matthias Schoenaerts; and had a cameo in Adam McKay's comedy film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, acting opposite Jim Carrey in the battle scene between rival news teams.

In 2014, she starred in the Dardenne brothers drama Two Days, One Night (Deux jours, une nuit), as Sandra, a Belgian factory worker who has just one weekend to convince her co-workers to give up their bonuses so that she can keep her job. The film premiered in the main competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and earned a 15-minute standing ovation, with Cotillard's performance praised as "a career-high performance", and favored to win the festival's Best Actress prize, which ended up going to Julianne Moore for Maps to the Stars. Several critics' awards followed, as well as a European Film Award for Best Actress, a second Academy Award nomination, making Cotillard the first actor to be nominated for a Belgian film, and a sixth César Award nomination. Her performances in both The Immigrant and Two Days, One Night shared the fourth spot on Time's list of Best Movie Performances of 2014. In November 2014, Cotillard participated on Comedy Central's All-Star Non-Denominational Christmas Special, in a duet with Nathan Fielder on the Elvis Presley song "Can't Help Falling in Love".
In 2015, Cotillard took on the role of Lady Macbeth in a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, directed by Justin Kurzel and starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and Cotillard's performance earned her a nomination for the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress, and high praise from critics, particularly for her "Out, Damned Spot" monologue. Variety critic Guy Lodge remarked: "Her deathless sleepwalking scene, staged in minimalist fashion under a gauze of snowflakes in a bare chapel, is played with tender, desolate exhaustion; it deserves to be viewed as near-definitive." That same year, she starred in the New York Philharmonic's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake, and voiced the roles of The Rose in both the English and French versions of Mark Osborne's The Little Prince, Scarlet Overkill in the French version of Minions; and April, the title character in the French-Canadian-Belgian 3D animated film April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le Monde Truqué).

She also played the role of Catherine, the sister-in-law of a gay playwright (portrayed by Gaspard Ulliel), who returns home to tell his family that he is dying in Xavier Dolan's Canadian-French co-production It's Only the End of the World (Juste la fin du Monde). Both films premiered in main competition at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, to polarized reactions from critics. It's Only the End of the World was a box office hit in France with over 1 million tickets sold. Also in 2016, Cotillard starred opposite Brad Pitt in Robert Zemeckis's Allied, a spy film set in World War II in which she played Marianne Beausejour, a French Resistance fighter. While critical reviews were mixed, Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine wrote that "Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that their chief mission is to tap the tradition of melodrama, and they take it seriously. Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady." The film grossed US$120 million worldwide. That same year, Cotillard reteamed with Macbeth director Justin Kurzel and co-star Michael Fassbender in the film adaptation of the video game Assassin's Creed.
On 30 January 2017, Cotillard was honoured with a special award for her career at the 22nd Lumière Awards in France. In 2017, she also starred in Guillaume Canet's satire comedy Rock'n Roll, and in Arnaud Desplechin's drama Ismael's Ghosts (Les Fantomes d'Ismaël), alongside Mathieu Amalric, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Louis Garrel. The Hollywood Reporter, in its review for the former film, asserted that "Cotillard offers up such a sincere performance that you can't help but laugh". In the 2018 drama Angel Face (Gueule d'ange) by director Vanessa Filho, she portrayed Marlene, a woman who suddenly chooses to abandon her daughter for a man she has just met during yet another night of excess. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2019, Cotillard was a member of the jury of the Chopard Trophy at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

In May 2014, Greenpeace released the animated video The Amazon's Silent Crisis, narrated by Cotillard. The video highlights the troubling illegal logging that threatens the Brazilian Amazon.
On 26 February 2015, she went to the Philippines along France's then-President François Hollande and actress Mélanie Laurent, to participate on a forum and encourage faster and more determined action on the global challenge of climate change. At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, director Mark Osborne revealed that Cotillard used to visit Children's Hospitals and play The Rose (from the book The Little Prince) for the kids, years before she voiced the character in the 2015 film The Little Prince, directed by Osborne.
Cotillard was the ambassador of "1 Heart 1 Tree", an art project that fights climate change through its Plant for the Planet reforestation program. On 29 November 2015, The Eiffel Tower became a virtual forest with trees and words encouraging environmental activism projected onto it every evening. Cotillard and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon inaugurated the light installation on the eve of the official opening of the COP21 conference. She also donated her shoes to be displayed among an installation of over 10,000 shoes at the Place de la Republique in Paris. The installation replaced a giant march for climate change which was forbidden by French authorities following the deadly attacks in the capital on 13 November, which cost 130 lives. It was a way of showing the determination of protesters in their fight against climate change, and allowed them to still send a strong message on the eve of the U.N. climate conference (COP21).
On 10 December 2015, Cotillard voiced the French version of the short film Home, made by Conservation International (CI). The short film debuted at the United Nations Momentum for Change Awards ceremony at the climate negotiations (COP21) in Paris. It was the latest addition to CI's award-winning Nature Is Speaking short film series. "Home" was produced to remind negotiators and world leaders at the climate talks of our common duty – how to care for the Earth that cares for us all. "This Earth is our shared home, our only home. The time to safeguard its future – and with it our own future – is right now," said Cotillard.
In 2018 she signed a letter calling for strong action to stop climate change and biodiversity loss. In 2019, she signed the petition Résister et créer ("Resist and Create"), created by the movement On Est Prêt along with Cyril Dion to challenge the world of cinema at a time of mobilizations for the climate.
She is a supporter of the French gender equality group Collectif 50/50. On 12 May 2018, Cotillard was one of the 82 women who marched up the stairs to the Cannes Film Festival to protest gender inequality in the film industry.
In March 2020, Cotillard participated on a PSA from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health to help educate people on COVID-19 and encouraged them to listen to the health experts to avoid spreading the virus.
In October 2022, Cotillard and other French actresses publicly cut locks from their hair in a video shared on social media with the hashtag #HairForFreedom in support of Iranian protesters following the death of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic of Iran's dress code by not wearing the hijab. In December 2022, Cotillard signed an open letter demanding the release of Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who had been arrested for standing in solidarity with imprisoned Iranian filmmakers who protested against the Iranian regime. Alidoosti was released on bail in January 2023.

== Personal life ==
Cotillard was a vegetarian for twelve years during her youth. However, she said she had to give up after falling ill because back then she had no idea about nutrition and just quit eating meat overnight and did not know she had to get protein from other sources to avoid a deficiency, which hurt her a lot physically.
In the late 1990s, Cotillard was in a relationship with French actor Julien Rassam. She had a long-term relationship with French actor Stéphan Guérin-Tillié from 2000 to 2005, with whom she co-starred in the short films Quelques jours de trop (2000) and Heureuse (2001), in the 2001 TV series Les redoutables, and in the 2005 feature films Cavalcade and Edy. She dated French singer Sinclair from 2005 to 2007.
From October 2007 to 2025, Cotillard was in a relationship with French actor and director Guillaume Canet. They had been friends since 1997, and co-starred together for the first time years later in the film Love Me If You Dare (2003), and later in The Last Flight (2009), Rock'n Roll (2017), and Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom (2023); and Canet directed Cotillard in Little White Lies (2010), Blood Ties (2013), Little White Lies 2 (2019), Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom (2023), and Karma (2026). They never got married. Though in 2010 Cotillard started wearing a diamond solitaire on her left hand — a present from Canet — they were not engaged either. In 2014, Cotillard denied being married to Canet, referring to him as "my boyfriend" in interviews. In 2011, they had their first child, a son, Marcel, and in 2017, their second child, a daughter, Louise was born. On 27 June 2025, Cotillard and Canet announced their separation in a joint statement to French news agency Agence France-Presse, saying that they made the separation public "to avoid all speculation, rumors and risky interpretations," and that they decided to separate after 18 years together by "mutual agreement" and with "mutual goodwill".
Cotillard lives in Paris with her children. In January 2018, Cotillard told The Hollywood Reporter that with her then 6-year-old son entering school and a newborn daughter, she would be slowing down her filming schedule for the time being. In a May 2023 interview with British magazine A Rabbit's Foot, she explained that she slowed down in order to protect her children, as she rarely chooses "lighthearted stories" and her roles were preventing her from living her life fully, citing La Vie en Rose (2007) and Macbeth (2015) as examples of that. "There are two kinds of actresses: those who burn themselves out, and those who manage to put the character aside and come home in the evening. Today, I'm halfway there. Since becoming a mother, I have put boundaries to protect my children", she said. Canet revealed in an interview with Libération in September 2023 that he and Cotillard had a deal to never shoot for long periods or at the same time, so their children would not be left in the care of a nanny.

In October 2021, a book entitled Le traître et le néant (English: The traitor and the nether) by two journalists from Le Monde, Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, was published in France. The book claimed that French president Emmanuel Macron had declared: "She pisses me off, Cotillard" (French: Elle me fait chier, Cotillard). Jean-Marc Dumontet is cited as eye-witness. This statement was in response to Cotillard's 2018 criticism of Macron's politics, especially environmental ones, when she stated in Le Parisien: "My faith in politics has been really undermined. He's making promises to have a good image and then behind [our backs] not keeping them at all. I find that unbearable."
In 2023, she was featured on the official poster of the 48th César Awards in a still from the 2021 film Annette, and also in an animated poster featuring Cotillard singing in the film.
