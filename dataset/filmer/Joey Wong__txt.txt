Joey Wong Cho-Yee (AKA Joey Wang, Wang Tsu Hsien) (Chinese: 王祖賢, born 31 January 1967) is a Taiwanese former actress and singer who rose to pan-Asian fame for her roles in Hong Kong films, particularly the film series A Chinese Ghost Story (1987–1991). After the film Shanghai Story (2004), she retired to Canada.


== Early life ==
Wong was born on 31 January 1967 and raised in Taipei, where she completed her secondary school. She has an older brother, a younger brother and a sister. Her father was a basketball player who encouraged her to become a professional basketball player. At 14, she shot a TV commercial for sport shoes which drew the attention of a film producer, who cast her in a leading role of the film It'll Be Very Cold by the Lakeside This Year. Her film debut attracted the attention of producer Mona Fong of Shaw Brothers who invited her to Hong Kong, where Wong appeared in the film Let's Make Laugh II, opposite Derek Yee Tung Sing. 


== Career ==
Wong's breakthrough came with her role of Nip Siu-sin in Tsui Hark's A Chinese Ghost Story (1987), which established her as a film icon across East Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea. Initially, Hark had wanted Japanese singer-actress Akina Nakamori to star in the film. Due to the language barrier and Nakamori unable to understand the story, she did not accept the invite. May Lo was Hark's second choice but her growing popularity at that time and could not fit the filming into her schedule. Wong then approached Hark’s wife, film producer Nansun Shi, for an audition and managed to score an audition with Hark. During the audition, Wong became a perfect fit for Hark's vision and was cast as Nip  
In the following years, she starred in numerous films, often playing supernatural or mythical characters such as ghosts or vixens. In 1989, Wong starred in the Japanese television series A Woman From Hong Kong. She made her singing debut in 1992 with the release of a single, Hold You in My Arms Forever, in both Japanese and Mandarin. The following year, she played the White Snake opposite Maggie Cheung's Green Snake in Tsui Hark’s Green Snake (1993), a reimagining of the Legend of the White Snake. 
In 1994, following controversy over her involvement in the marriage of businessman Peter Lam, Wong announced her intention to retire from acting and largely withdrew from the public eye. She made a brief return in 1997, starring in the Japanese film Peking Genjin (Peking Man) and releasing a companion CD single, Who Are You?. In 1998, she released the extended Japanese CD Angelus and her first and only full-length Mandarin album, Isolation (also known as Isolated From the World). Following the album’s release, she entered semi-retirement but returned to film in 2001 with Peony Pavilion. Shortly after, she announced her retirement again in 2002 after ending her long-term relationship with Taiwanese singer Chyi Chin. In 2004, Wong made her final film appearance in Shanghai Story. However, the unexpected suicide of her close friend and A Chinese Ghost Story co-star Leslie Cheung led her to withdraw from the entertainment industry entirely. She subsequently emigrated to Vancouver, Canada, where she has led a devout Buddhist life. In 2025, she opened a moxibustion center in Vancouver.


== Personal life ==
Wong had a long-term on-and-off relationship with Taiwanese singer Chyi Chin that began in 1985 and ended in 2002. During a period of separation from Chin in the early 1990s, Wong was in a relationship with Hong Kong businessman Peter Lam, who at the time was married to Tse Ling-ling. The affair received significant media attention, compounded by strong opposition from Lam’s parents, who were closely aligned with Tse and publicly accused Wong of breaking up their family. The controversy was a major factor in Wong’s gradual withdrawal and eventual retirement from the entertainment industry.
