== Early life ==
Guillaume was born Robert Peter Williams in St. Louis to an alcoholic mother. After she abandoned him and several siblings, they were raised by their grandmother, Jeannette Williams.

He adopted the surname Guillaume (French for William) as his stage name.

=== Stage ===

After college, Guillaume joined the Karamu Players in Cleveland and performed in musical comedies and opera. He toured the world in 1959 as a cast member of the Broadway musical Free and Easy. He made his Broadway debut in Kwamina in 1961. His other stage appearances included Golden Boy (with Sammy Davis Jr.), Tambourines to Glory, Guys and Dolls, for which he received a Tony Award nomination, Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, and Purlie. His additional roles included Katherine Dunham's Bambouche and in Fly The Blackbird.
In 1964, Guillaume portrayed Sportin' Life in a revival of Porgy and Bess at New York City Center. Guillaume was a member of the Robert De Cormier Singers, performing in concerts and on television. He recorded an LP album, Columbia CS9033, titled Just Arrived, as a member of The Pilgrims, a folk trio, with Angeline Butler and Millard Williams. Columbia records producer Tom Wilson had set out to create the Pilgrims as an answer to the popular folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. By early 1964, the Pilgrims had recorded a handful of songs and Wilson was looking for the right song for the group's debut single when a then-unknown singer/songwriter named Paul Simon arrived for a meeting with Wilson and eventually pitched his new composition, "The Sound of Silence". Wilson liked the song and had Simon record a demo for the group, but when Simon and his friend, Art Garfunkel, sang the song for Wilson in person, he signed them to a record contract instead of using it for The Pilgrims.
In 1976, Guillaume played Nathan Detroit in the Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls and was nominated for a Tony Award.
In 1990, Guillaume was cast in the Los Angeles production of The Phantom of the Opera, replacing Michael Crawford in the title role. Guillaume was the first Black actor to portray the character.

In 1985, Guillaume appeared in the television mini-series North and South as abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, who escaped from slavery and became a leader of the anti-slavery movement prior to the American Civil War.
