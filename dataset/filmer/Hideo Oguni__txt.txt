== Career ==
Oguni's first film with Kurosawa was Ikiru (1952). The film has a two-part structure which was devised by Oguni. Film critic Donald Richie regarded him as the "humanist" among Kurosawa's writers.
Writing credits other than for Kurosawa films include Heinosuke Gosho's Where Chimneys Are Seen (1953), Koji Shima's Warning from Space (1956), Bin Kato's Heiji Zenigata: Chase the Demon Lantern (1958), Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970), and Hiroshi Inagaki's Machibuse (1970).
In 2013, Oguni and his frequent collaborators—Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Ryūzō Kikushima—were awarded the Jean Renoir Award by the Writers Guild of America West.
