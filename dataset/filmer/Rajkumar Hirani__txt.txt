Rajkumar "Raju" Hirani (born 20 November 1962) is an Indian filmmaker known for his works in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several accolades, including four National Film Awards and 11 Filmfare Awards. Hirani is referred as one of the most successful filmmakers of Indian cinema. His movies are often lighthearted but revolve around significant societal issues with humour and emotional intelligence.
Starting his career as a film editor after graduating from FTII in editing, a bad experience forced him to shift to ad films, where he made several successful ads. His first film as a professional editor was Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000). Although Hirani wanted to make films, he took a one-year break and came back with the script of the comedy-drama Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. to Chopra to help him finance it, who agreed. Upon release, the film emerged as a widespread critical and commercial success. It won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Award for Best Film (Critics) and earned Hirani the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay and his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. Rajkumar Hirani and his longtime collaborator Abhijat Joshi have jointly won the IIFA Award for Best Dialogue three times, making them the most awarded duo in this category.
After the success of MBBS, he helmed its sequel Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), which emerged as the second-highest grosser of the year and the coming-of-age comedy-drama 3 Idiots (2009) emerged as the highest grossing Indian film of its time. Both of them won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and were nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, with 3 Idiots, winning all three categories. His next film, the science fiction religious satire PK (2014), again emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of its time and the biographical comedy-drama Sanju (2018) based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt released to critical and commercial success. Both films were nominated for Best Film and Best Director at the Filmfare Awards, with PK winning him the Best Screenplay. Domestically, both films are currently the fifth and seventh highest grossing Bollywood films.  He is the founder of the production house Rajkumar Hirani Films. In 2019, Hirani directed a two‑minute commemorative short film on Mahatma Gandhi to mark the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth. Commissioned as part of a government initiative, the star‑studded video featured leading actors such as Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor and others, and focused on Gandhi's key principles like non‑violence and truth.

== Early life and education ==
Hirani was born on 20 November 1962 in Nagpur to a Sindhi Hindu family. His ancestors originally belonged to Mehrabpur, a city now in the Naushahro Firoz District, Sindh, of Pakistan. His father Suresh Hirani ran a typing institute in Nagpur. Hirani studied at St. Francis De'Sales High School, Nagpur, Maharashtra. He did his graduation in commerce. His parents wanted him to be an engineer, but he was more keen on theatre and film.

In his college days, he was involved with Hindi theatre. He had many friends in Nagpur's medical college and hence, spent much time in theatre at the college. Suresh had his son's photographs taken and sent him to an acting school in Mumbai. However, Hirani could not fit in and returned to Nagpur after three days. His father then asked him to apply to the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, but the acting course had shut down and his chances of admission to the directorial course looked slim as there were far too many applicants. Hirani opted for the film editing course, and earned a scholarship.At a public event in 2025, Hirani described himself as a “huge fan” of filmmaker Satyajit Ray, recalling that during his time in film school he would spend “weeks and months” watching Ray’s films to study their craft and storytelling.

== Style, themes and influence ==

Hirani's films are often based on themes that explore particularly different critical social issues like middle-class aspirations, reforms, self-conviction and relationships, albeit with healthy humour and an immense emotional quotient. Hirani is the editor of all of his films; he has himself admitted that he enjoys editing films more than anything else. Rajeev Masand wrote, in a review, "[L]ike those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, [Rajkumar] Hirani's film reinforced importance of human goodness and basic niceties". Hirani cites Mukherjee's Anand (1971) as his favourite film.
Munna Bhai MBBS (2003) deals with the corruption of hospitals and the cruelty of doctors, Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006) deals with Gandhi's thinking and reforming people with soft-hearted behaviour, 3 Idiots (2009) with the education system, pressure on students for marks and passion of individuals, PK (2014) with religion and superstition and Sanju (2018) with relationships and media outrage. Film critic Komal Nahta called Hirani "a magician more than a director" while reviewing Sanju, adding that he "narrates the complex story of a misdirected, ignorant, and foolish young man with such sensitivity that the human drama becomes quite a masterpiece of a film."

All of Hirani's films were co-produced by Vinod Chopra Films till Sanju, after which they broke their ties owing to creative differences. He had edited one of Chopra's films Mission Kashmir (2000) professionally. Hirani has worked consistently with writer Abhijat Joshi since Lage Raho Munna Bhai, and has often cast the same actors in his projects, particularly Sanjay Dutt, who has collaborated with Hirani on three feature films and one film which itself is based on Dutt. Aamir Khan has collaborated on two films with Hirani, one also starring Dutt. Boman Irani has featured in all of Hirani's films in pivotal supporting roles.
Hirani is considered a pioneer of his own cinematic style. He has garnered appraisal from several industry's successful makers and his contemporaries like Karan Johar who said,

 I've been pitted against everyone and I feel envious, not jealous. I am envious of Rajkumar Hirani. I've never managed to do what he does. His movies have genius ideas. I don't have the ability perhaps. I would love to make those kinds of movies. He has strong screenplays. I hope I get such screenplays.
Director Anurag Kashyap called him the bravest filmmaker, he added: Generally, we filmmakers get into our subject to prove its poignancy so much that we end up making it less effective for the audience. But Raju didn't do that.
SS Rajamouli said during the promotion of Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) that he is a huge fan of Hirani's films and that he "cannot make one scene the way [Rajkumar] Hirani does".

Screenwriter Javed Akhtar praised Hirani's work saying,  "I am a huge admirer of Rajkumar Hirani. He does really good work and now again, he has done an amazing job. I always say one thing about him, that to make such kind of films, you not only have to be a really good director or writer, you have to be really a good human being as well. Hirani has described that his approach to writing and directing is guided by what he calls the “LCD formula,” in which every scene is designed to evoke either laughter, emotion that makes the audience cry, or dramatic tension. According to him, this principle helps ensure consistent emotional engagement throughout his films.Hirani has often emphasized that his storytelling sensibilities are rooted in everyday life, remarking in an interview that he "strongly believes stories come from small towns," reflecting his preference for narratives grounded in relatable, real-world experiences.In an October 2025 discussion on the social impact of films, Hirani stated that “cinema shouldn’t bear the burden of fixing morality,” emphasizing that a filmmaker’s primary responsibility is to tell engaging stories rather than to enforce moral codes.


== Personal life ==
Hirani married Manjeet Hirani, a pilot in Air India, in 1994. They have a son, Vir Hirani, who is also pursuing filmmaking.
Rajkumar Hirani has a brother, Sanjeev Hirani, who works as a computer consultant in the United States and a sister, Anju Kishanchandani, who is a journalist. Hirani later produced her play Growing Up, which addressed themes of adolescence and was written by Kishanchandani.
