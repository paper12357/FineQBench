Making his film debut in 1955, Brook appeared in over 100 film and television productions. He also worked in the theatre, playing the lead role in the Mexican premiere of Man of La Mancha in Mexico City in 1969.
One of his most fruitful collaborations was with director Luis Buñuel, appearing in five of the director's films over the course of nine years: The Young One (1960), Viridiana (1961), The Exterminating Angel (1962) Simon of the Desert (1965), and The Milky Way (1969).
