In 2019, Gavin & Stacey returned for a Christmas special, with the episode achieving the highest Christmas Day viewership in the UK for more than a decade.
During the two year and seven months run of Gavin & Stacey, Corden's professional endeavours outside the successful series proved somewhat chequered. He guest hosted Big Brother's Big Mouth, with Gavin & Stacey co-star Mathew Horne, in August 2007. In 2008, he appeared in the film of Toby Young's 2001 autobiography How to Lose Friends & Alienate People. He collaborated again with Horne on a 2009 sketch show named Horne & Corden, described by the BBC as a "traditional comedy entertainment show in the style of Morecambe and Wise". The show ran for only one series and was poorly received by the critics, with Corden later admitting "the absolute truth is I wasn't good enough."
In 2009, Corden starred as the lead character in the film Lesbian Vampire Killers, which was not successful. That year he played Clem Cattini in the Joe Meek biopic Telstar, and likewise in the animated Planet 51 along with Mathew Horne. In February 2009, he co-presented the Brit Awards with Horne and Kylie Minogue.

In 2011, he appeared in The Three Musketeers.
Starting in June 2011, Corden played the lead role in the hit comedy play One Man, Two Guvnors. The play was cinecast worldwide as part of the National Theatre Live cinecasts, and transferred from the National Theatre to the West End after touring. The show received universal critical acclaim and won Best Play at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards for 2011. The Guardian deemed it "A triumph of visual and verbal comedy. One of the funniest productions in the National's history." The Daily Telegraph described it as "the feelgood hit of the Summer"; while The Independent called it a "massive hit", and the Evening Standard "a surefire hit".
Corden made a cameo appearance in the music video for the single "Mama Do the Hump" by Rizzle Kicks, released in December 2011, which reached No. 2 in the charts. In April 2012, One Man, Two Guvnors transferred to Broadway, with Corden continuing to play the lead. In June 2012, he won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his performance.

The premiere was in September 2013. The series was co-produced by online television provider Hulu in the United States and it began airing in November 2013.


=== 2015–2023: The Late Late Show and stardom ===

In March 2015, Corden succeeded Craig Ferguson as host of the American late-night talk show The Late Late Show. Corden's most popular comedic segments included "Drop the Mic", "Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts", "Crosswalk the Musical", and "Carpool Karaoke".
Talking to David Tenant on his BBC Podcast David Tennant Does a Podcast With…, Tenant asked how much of The Late Late Show was him and how much was acting, to which Corden replied: "...I would hope it's a close strain to me, I would hope that I am someone who looks for the joy in things and stuff, you're not [pause] ever really being your ...self"
Corden's Carpool Karaoke through the streets of London with pop singer Adele, a sketch that was featured on his talk show in January 2016, was the biggest YouTube viral video of 2016. Corden did numerous editions of Carpool Karaoke with singers such as Sir Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Harry Styles, and Katy Perry. Apple TV+ adapted the segment into a streaming series Carpool Karaoke: The Series.
Corden's special Carpool Karaoke: When Corden Met McCartney, Live From Liverpool with Sir Paul McCartney was a viral and critical success earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and win for Outstanding Variety Special. In the special, Corden and McCartney sang the Beatles songs "Drive My Car", "Penny Lane", and "Let It Be". The pair stopped by a Penny Lane street sign, which McCartney signed. McCartney pointed out various Liverpool landmarks, including Saint Barnabas Church, where he had been a choir boy, and also visited his childhood home. The special ended with McCartney and his band surprising a small group of locals at Liverpool's Philharmonic Pub with a 13-song set that included "A Hard Day's Night", "Back in the U.S.S.R" and his new single, "Come On to Me".
Corden hosted the Tony Awards in 2016 and 2019, and the Grammy Awards in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, the Seatbelt Psychic television series was produced by Corden and his production company Fulwell 73 for Lifetime platform.
In 2019, Corden starred in Tom Hooper's feature film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's popular musical Cats as Bustopher Jones, which received widespread negative attention. The film also featured Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench. Some critics called it one of the worst films of the year due to its poorly conceived CGI and off kilter comedic performances from Rebel Wilson and Corden. For his performance, Corden received the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor of the year. Lloyd Webber was a vocal critic of the film, specially criticizing Corden's performance, adding he "begged for it to be cut".
Corden's leading role in the 2020 musical comedy film The Prom received negative reviews, and was named "one of the worst performances of the 21st century" by Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson. Lawson elaborated, writing: "Corden, flitting and lisping around in the most uninspired of caricatures, misses all potential for nuance, and thus never finds even a hint of truth in the role". His portrayal of a gay man while he himself is straight was deemed offensive by many film critics and members of the LBGTQ community with critics adding that the performance perpetuated and capitalized on stereotypes of gay white men. Corden received an even larger amount of backlash when this performance earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Film.
Corden also received negative reviews for his performance in the 2021 adaptation of Cinderella, a film that he produced. Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent wrote: "James Corden has made a #Girlboss fairytale only a voracious capitalist could love".
In 2021, the Late Late Show segment "Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts" was criticised for its "racist" use of Asian cuisine, such as balut and chicken feet. Celebrity guests were made to eat foods that Corden had judged to be “horrific” and “disgusting” or answer a difficult personal question. Corden later agreed to change the foods used.
In April 2022, Corden announced that he would be leaving The Late Late Show in 2023.


=== 2024–present: The Constituent and Gavin & Stacey finale ===
On 20 March 2024, it was announced that Corden would make his return to theatre, starring as Alec in a new political drama by Joe Penhall called The Constituent, opposite Anna Maxwell Martin and directed by Matthew Warchus.
