After working in a Houston law firm for four years, he decided to pursue screenwriting and moved to Los Angeles.

With a budget of $29 million, the film grossed over $309 million, becoming Hancock's highest-grossing film to date, and received two Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Actress, with Bullock winning the latter award. Bullock also won Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe awards for her portrayal of Tuohy.
