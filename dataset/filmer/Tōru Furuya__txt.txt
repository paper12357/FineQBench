Tōru Furuya (古谷 徹, Furuya Tōru; born July 31, 1953, in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture) is a Japanese actor and narrator. As a child, he was a member of Gekidan Himawari, a children's acting troupe. He is currently employed by the talent management firm Aoni Production, since 1982.
Furuya is most known for the anime roles of Amuro Ray (Gundam), Hyūma Hoshi (Star of the Giants), Pegasus Seiya (Saint Seiya), Yamcha (Dragon Ball), Kyōsuke Kasuga (Kimagure Orange Road) and Tuxedo Mask (Sailor Moon). He considers these roles as his most important roles. He also voiced Mario in several anime and commercials, starting with the film Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach! (1986).
He also used a pseudonym Noboru Sōgetsu (蒼月 昇, Sōgetsu Noboru) in the cast of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 for Ribbons Almark's role (but used his real name in the narration role) and in the casting of Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi for Zen Kirishima. Both the narration role and Ribbons Almark were Furuya's first role in a non-Universal Century Gundam series. He is also the best known official dubbing voice for Hong Kong action film actor, Yuen Biao.


== Personal life ==
Furuya married voice actress Mami Koyama in 1976; they later divorced in 1983. He married Satomi Majima on March 23, 1985. 
On May 22, 2024, Furuya posted a public apology to Twitter, confirming a recent report and interview in Shūkan Bunshun magazine in which it was reported that he had an extramarital affair with a female fan 37 years his junior for around four and a half years, until September 2023. He admitted to striking her once, as well as pressuring her into having an abortion. 
Because of this, his Showroom program was abruptly cancelled and he was dropped from Metaphor: ReFantazio with all of his characters getting recast. 
On June 22, 2024, Furuya announced that he would step down from his roles in Detective Conan and One Piece. On June 28, 2024, Bandai Namco began considering to employ a new voice actor to portray Amuro Ray for later works in the Gundam series in the wake of Furuya's affair being made public. On October 4, 2024, Toei Animation announced that the role of Yamcha had been recast to Ryōta Suzuki for Dragon Ball Daima.


== Appearances ==
Furuya was featured as a guest at Tsukino-Con in British Columbia in February 2017. Furuya was going to be featured as a guest at MomoCon 2024, but his appearance was cancelled due to the affair/abuse scandal.
