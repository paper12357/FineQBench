Franco Ferrini (born 5 January 1944) is an Italian screenwriter. 
Ferrini was initially a film critic. Ferrini had worked on projects such as Elio Petri's unmade spy film Chi illumine la grande notte and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (1984). While Ferrini is credited as a screenwriter one of the five credited screenwriters on the film, intensive revisions of the drafts for the film were done during the later half of the 1970s. Leone has cited Stuart Kaminsky and Leonardo Benvenuti as the principal contributors who "miraculously concluded" the screenplay.
Ferrini has made several films collaborating with Dario Argento, with the first being Phenomena (1985). He was one of the interviewees represented in the book Spaghetti Nightmares.
