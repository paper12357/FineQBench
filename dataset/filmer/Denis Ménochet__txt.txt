Elizabeth Weitzman, a film critic for New York Daily News, praised Ménochet's work opposite Christoph Waltz in the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds. Weitzman wrote in August 2009, "The terrific opening, for example, does feature a hailstorm of bullets. What you'll remember best, though, is the haunted silence of actor Denis Ménochet, playing a French farmer accused of harboring Jews."
In 2018, Ménochet appeared as Daniel in the film Mary Magdalene, written by Helen Edmundson.
In 2022, Ménochet co-starred opposite Zar Amir Ebrahimi in the thriller White Paradise, directed by Guillaume Renusson.
In May 2023, Ménochet served as a member of the Feature-Film Jury at the Festival de Cannes, presided over by Ruben Östlund. He stated that performances in films such as Custody (Jusqu’à la garde), By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu), White Paradise (Les Survivants), and The Beasts (As Bestas) made him realize the emotional impact his acting could have on audiences. 
In 2024, he starred in Chien blanc, directed by Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette, an adaptation of Romain Gary’s novel White Dog. The film, also featuring Kacey Rohl, deals with racial tensions in Los Angeles in 1968.
