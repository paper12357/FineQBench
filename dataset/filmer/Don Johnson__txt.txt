== Early life ==
Johnson was born on December 15, 1949, in his grandmother's house in Flat Creek, Missouri. His mother, Nell (née Wilson), was a beautician. His father, Fredie Wayne Johnson, was a farmer. At the time of his birth, Johnson's mother and father were 16 and 19 years old, respectively. Johnson was raised in Wichita, Kansas, where his parents relocated when he was five years old and where his father worked for Boeing Aircraft. He has described his childhood as "incredibly dysfunctional and abusive" as his parents were both frequently absent and stressed. His father subjected the children to corporal punishment. According to Johnson, he was 12 years old when he lost his virginity to his 16-year-old babysitter. Johnson's parents divorced when he was 12. He continued to live with his mother, younger sister and two younger brothers until he was 13, at which time he ended up in juvenile court and was sent to live with his father in Missouri.
He moved back home to Wichita for his senior year of high school, working part-time as a butcher's apprentice and ladies' shoe salesman. He attended Wichita South High School, from which he graduated in 1967. When he was kicked off the school's football team, Johnson enrolled in a drama class to earn enough credits to graduate. Encouraged by his teacher, he played the lead role of Tony in West Side Story. He was also exposed to the plays  of Molière, Tennessee Williams and Shakespeare. During his last semester, he auditioned for the summer repertory program at the University of Kansas and won a partial scholarship. He was subsequently awarded a full scholarship to attend as a drama major. There, Johnson, 18, dated his 29-year-old acting teacher. In his sophomore year, he left to San Francisco after passing an audition for the American Conservatory Theater.


== Acting career ==


=== Early years ===
Johnson's first major role was in the 1969 stage production of Fortune and Men's Eyes, in which he played the lead role of Smitty. The play was produced and directed by Sal Mineo at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. It included a "shockingly realistic prison rape" scene portrayed by Johnson. This exposure led to the quickly forgotten film The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970). Johnson continued to work on stage, film and television without breaking into stardom. His notable films from this period were Zachariah (1971), Lollipop and Roses (1971), The Harrad Experiment (1973) (a film in which Johnson displayed frontal nudity) and A Boy and His Dog (1975). In 1976, Johnson was the roommate of Sal Mineo at the time Mineo was murdered.


=== Miami Vice and stardom ===

In 1984, after years of struggling to establish himself as a TV actor, Johnson landed a starring role as undercover police detective Sonny Crockett in the Michael Mann/Universal Television cop series, Miami Vice. The show ran from 1984 to 1990. Miami Vice made Johnson "a major international star". According to Rolling Stone, "No one had more swagger in the Reagan era than Don Johnson. As Miami Vice's Sonny Crockett, the undercover detective and professional stubble-cultivator who lived on a houseboat with his pet alligator Elvis, he embodied masculine cool in the era of coke binges and Lamborghinis". The Sonny Crockett character typically wore thousand-dollar Versace and Armani suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari, wore expensive timepieces by Rolex and Ebel, and lived on an Endeavour yacht. Miami Vice was noted for its revolutionary use of music and cinematography, and for its glitzy take on the police drama genre. In the show, Crockett's partner was Ricardo Tubbs, played by Philip Michael Thomas.
Johnson's work on Miami Vice earned him a Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama, in 1986. He was nominated for the same award in 1987. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.
Between seasons on Miami Vice, Johnson gained further renown through the TV miniseries The Long Hot Summer (1985), a remake of the 1958 film. During the time he was on Miami Vice, he had set up an hour-long music video/pay cable program with videocassette versions of the programs Johnson had hosted being handled by distributor CBS/Fox Video. The project was a tie-in to his first album Heartbeat, which was released by CBS/Epic Records in 1986.
In 1988, he starred in the romantic comedy Sweet Hearts Dance, alongside Susan Sarandon, Jeff Daniels and Elizabeth Perkins. In 1989 he played the sheriff of Los Angeles County Jerry Beck in John Frankenheimer's film Dead Bang.
In the early 1990s, Johnson played a variety of roles in well-produced films, including the role of drifter and car salesman Harry Maddox in Dennis Hopper's The Hot Spot (1990) opposite Jennifer Connelly and Virginia Madsen. He worked on two films with his wife Melanie Griffith, Paradise (1991) and Born Yesterday (1993). He appeared alongside Mickey Rourke in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991), and in Sidney Lumet's thriller Guilty as Sin (1993), opposite Rebecca De Mornay.

In Nash Bridges, Johnson was again paired with a flashy convertible car, a yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda.

In the fall of 2005, Johnson briefly starred in The WB courtroom television drama show Just Legal as a jaded lawyer with a young and idealistic protégé/partner (Jay Baruchel); the show was canceled in October 2005 after just three of the eight produced episodes aired. In January 2007, Johnson began a run in the West End of London production of Guys and Dolls as Nathan Detroit.
Johnson also had a role in the Norwegian comedy Lange Flate Ballær 2 ("Long Flat Balls II"), directed by Johnson's friend Harald Zwart. Johnson did the movie as a favor to Zwart. The movie was launched on March 14, 2008, in Norway, with Johnson making an appearance at the premiere. He next appeared in When in Rome with Danny DeVito, Anjelica Huston and Kristen Bell.

== Personal life ==


=== Reputation ===
Outside his acting career, Johnson developed a reputation for leading a luxurious and hedonistic lifestyle. He was known for his hard-partying and having a large number of romantic relationships. At the height of his Miami Vice fame in the 1980s, he was a frequent drug user, including alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as Quaaludes. Johnson has described hosting parties where he and friends would invite numerous models through local modeling agencies. He was also a regular at "super-exclusive" parties in Florida attended by politicians, police, drug dealers, and "the best-looking hookers in the business".


=== Relationships and family ===

In 1968, at the age of 18, Johnson married a dancer; the marriage was annulled around two months later. Her name has not been made public.
Circa 1971, Johnson lived with self-described "groupie" Pamela Des Barres.
In 1973, Johnson married his second wife, but the marriage was annulled days later. Her name has also not been made public, though he has called her a "rich bimbo".
During the first half of 1972, Johnson met Melanie Griffith, the 14-year-old daughter of his Harrad Experiment co-star Tippi Hedren. The pair moved in together when Griffith was 15 and Johnson was 23. On her 18th birthday they became engaged, and were married in January 1976; they separated that July and divorced in November.
Johnson dated country music singer Tanya Tucker after the two worked together on the 1979 TV movies Amateur Night at the Dixie Bar and Grill and The Rebels.
In 1980, Johnson dated Sally Adams, mother of actress Nicollette Sheridan.
In January 1981, he split from Tucker after meeting Warhol model Patti D'Arbanville at a Los Angeles restaurant. The pair lived together from 1981 to 1985 but never married. Johnson and D'Arbanville have a son, Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982).
In the early 1980s, Johnson dated model Donya Fiorentino after he moved in next door to her family in Florida. Fiorentino broke up with Johnson but reunited with him in 1986 after she broke up with Andrew Ridgeley.
In her 2000 autobiography Cybill Disobedience, Cybill Shepherd wrote of a liaison with Johnson during the making of the television miniseries The Long Hot Summer (1985).
Johnson next had a relationship with Barbra Streisand, lasting into at least September 1988.
He was briefly involved with his Dead Bang (1989) co-star Penelope Ann Miller.
Just days after breaking up with Streisand, Johnson, then 38, was linked to 18-year-old Uma Thurman.
Johnson then reunited with Griffith, who conceived his child close to the start of 1989, Dakota Johnson (born October 4, 1989); they were married again from June of that year until 1996.
In 1995, Johnson was romantically linked to model Kari Whitman.
In 1996–1997, Johnson dated Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, who played his daughter on Nash Bridges.
On April 29, 1999, Johnson married San Francisco socialite and Montessori nursery school teacher Kelley Phleger, former longtime girlfriend of Governor Gavin Newsom, at the Pacific Heights mansion of Ann and Gordon Getty. Actor Robert Wagner served as best man, and Mayor Willie Brown presided over the civil ceremony. Johnson and Phleger have three children together: a daughter, Atherton Grace (born December 28, 1999), and two sons, Jasper Breckinridge (born June 6, 2002), and Deacon (born April 29, 2006).
Johnson was "best friends" with journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote for Nash Bridges, and his daughter Dakota saw Thompson as a "godfather figure." Johnson is also a friend of socialite Denise Hale, the former wife of director Vincente Minnelli. The two were once the subject of reports alleging a romantic relationship, which both denied, stating they were merely friends.


=== Powerboat racing ===
Johnson entered powerboat racing and sometimes raced with Kurt Russell and Chuck Norris. In 1986, Johnson achieved his first motor sport victory. He won a 1,100-mile (1,800 km) powerboat race up the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis. Characterized by shipmates as an aggressive, fearless pilot who did not make mistakes, Johnson became American Power Boat Association's World Champion of the Offshore World Cup in 1988.


=== Legal matters ===
In April 1997, Johnson was sued by his former chauffeur and a former production assistant for Nash Bridges, both of whom accused him of sexual harassment. Johnson accused them of defamation and alleged they had conspired to extort $1.5 million from him. In January 1998, Johnson and the two women dropped civil charges against each other in a confidential settlement.
In July 2001, a woman sued Johnson, alleging that he grabbed her inappropriately at a sushi bar in San Francisco. The district attorney reviewed the evidence and declined to file criminal charges. Johnson's representatives maintained the accusations were meritless.
In November 2002, German customs officers at the Swiss–German border performed a routine search of Johnson's car. Bank statements evidencing US$8 billion in transactions were found in the trunk of his car. He was accompanied in his black Mercedes-Benz by three men: an investment adviser, a personal assistant, and a third unknown individual who could not be identified. Initially it was thought Johnson was involved in money laundering, but he was cleared of wrongdoing.
In May 2008, within hours of losing his Woody Creek, Colorado, home to foreclosure, Johnson paid off his $14.5 million debt.
In July 2010, a Los Angeles jury awarded Johnson $23.2 million in a lawsuit against production company Rysher Entertainment, from whom Johnson sought a share of profits commensurate with his ownership of half the copyright of Nash Bridges. Rysher announced it would appeal the verdict. In January 2013, Rysher settled the suit with a $19 million payment.
