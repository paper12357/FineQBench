Tatsuya Nakadai (仲代 達矢, Nakadai Tatsuya; born Motohisa Nakadai; December 13, 1932 – November 8, 2025) was a Japanese actor. Widely regarded as one of the greatest actors in the history of Japanese cinema, he collaborated extensively with many of Japan's best-known and acclaimed directors. In his over seven decade career, he appeared in more than 160 films, and received numerous accolades. He was honored with a Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1996 and Japan's Order of Culture in 2015.
Discovered on the streets of Tokyo by director Masaki Kobayashi, Nakadai rose to prominence starring in Kobayashi's films, with his breakthrough being in the epic anti-war trilogy The Human Condition (1959–1961). He won the Blue Ribbon Award for Best Actor for his performance as the vengeful ronin in Harakiri (1962), a role he considered his finest. Nakadai collaborated on eleven films with Kobayashi—including Kwaidan (1964) and Samurai Rebellion (1967)—and five with Akira Kurosawa, most notably as the doomed warlord in Ran (1985), a performance that earned global acclaim. His other notable credits include Seven Samurai (1954), Conflagration (1958), When a Woman Ascends the Stairs (1960), Yojimbo (1961), Sanjuro (1962), High and Low (1963), The Sword of Doom, The Face of Another (both 1966), Kill! (1968), Goyokin (1969), Kagemusha (1980), and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013).
A lifelong stage actor, he founded the acting school Mumeijuku in 1975 and continued performing on stage into his nineties.


== Early life and career ==

Tatsuya Nakadai was born on December 13, 1932 in Tokyo as the second of four children and was raised in Chiba. His father worked as a bus driver, and after his death in 1941, the family moved to Aoyama. As a young man, Nakadai took up acting as a student at the Haiyuza Training School. He made a brief and uncredited cameo in Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai where he is seen for a few seconds as a samurai walking through town. Nakadai's role in Seven Samurai was technically his debut as The Thick-Walled Room's release was delayed for three years due to controversial subject matter. His major breakthrough as an actor came when he was given the part of Jo, a young yakuza in Black River, another film directed by Kobayashi. Nakadai continued to work with Kobayashi into the 1960s and won his first Blue Ribbon Award for his role in Harakiri (his personal favorite among his own films) as the aging rōnin Hanshiro Tsugumo.
Nakadai appeared in two more Kurosawa films in the 1980s. In Kagemusha, Nakadai plays both the titular thief turned body-double and the famous daimyō Takeda Shingen whom the thief is tasked with impersonating. This dual role helped him win his second Blue Ribbon Award for Best Actor. In Ran, Nakadai plays another daimyō, Hidetora Ichimonji (loosely based on King Lear from Shakespeare's play King Lear and inspired by the historical daimyō Mōri Motonari).
He was also active in stage. His final performance was in May 2025 in Noto, Ishikawa, as part of a stage tour.
In 1975, he founded the acting school Mumeijuku with his wife Yasuko Miyazaki. There, he taught and trained promising young actors including Kōji Yakusho, Mayumi Wakamura, Azusa Watanabe, and Kenichi Takitō, among others. In 1996, he received the Medal with Purple Ribbon, and in 2015, he received the Order of Culture.


== Death ==
Nakadai died from pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital on November 8, 2025, at the age of 92. His death was disclosed three days later, on November 11. Some sources erroneously claimed that he died on November 11, however, according to his talent agency, he died at 12:25 a.m. on November 8 (Japan Standard Time). He had been hospitalized two weeks prior to his death due to injuries. His daughter was at his side at the time of his death. It was announced that his funeral and memorial service would be held over the coming days, and that it would only be open to close relatives.
