=== Acting ===
Hauser portrayed Shawn Eckhardt in the 2017 film I, Tonya, Dale in the 2010 film Virginia, and Keith in the television series Kingdom. Hauser was initially cast as an extra for Virginia as his acting debut, and complimented director Dustin Lance Black for his speech after winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2009 for Milk (2008); this led to Black writing him a larger role in the movie.
He had the recurring role of Deshawn in the Amazon web series Betas, and in 2018 appeared as Lonnie Laloush in Super Troopers 2 and as Ivanhoe in BlacKkKlansman. He has also appeared as a guest star on the television series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Night Shift, Superstore, Key & Peele, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Community, Blunt Talk, I Think You Should Leave, Bupkis, and Cobra Kai.

Critic Nick Schager wrote of Hauser's performance, "even in a sea of maniacal villains, his Larry Hall stands out as a uniquely cunning madman, so unpredictable and unnerving as to be downright unforgettable."
In 2024, he voiced a lead role in the DreamWorks Animation film Orion and the Dark and the role of Embarrassment in the Pixar film Inside Out 2.
In 2024, Hauser became attached to the true-crime drama Fruitcake alongside Jennifer Garner; the lead role in a bio-pic about actor-comedian Chris Farley; a reboot of The Naked Gun franchise; the Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025); a biographical film about Bruce Springsteen titled Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere in the role of recording engineer and guitar tech Mike Batlan; and the comedy Balls Up alongside Mark Wahlberg.
