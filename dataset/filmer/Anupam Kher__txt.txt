== Acting career ==


=== Debut and early career (1984–1988) ===
Anupam Kher made his acting debut in 1984 with Mahesh Bhatt's drama film Saaransh. It didn't perform well commercially, but was a huge critical success and was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Kher received widespread acclaim for his portraying a 60-year-old man trying to come to terms with the loss of his only son and won his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The following year, however, none of his films performed well critically or commercially with Rahul Rawail's action drama Arjun co-starring Sunny Deol and Dimple Kapadia being the exception. This changed in 1986 when he co-starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in K. Bhagyaraj's crime drama Aakhree Raasta and played the ruthless villain "Dr. Michael Dang" in Subhash Ghai's ensemble actioner Karma, which had Dilip Kumar, Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Sridevi in the lead. While the former was a hit, Karma went on to become a blockbuster and Kher was noticed by the audience. The same year, he played supporting role in another major commercial success, which was - Insaaf Ki Awaaz.
In 1987, he appeared alongside Rekha and Raj Babbar in T. Rama Rao's family drama Sansar, which was a commercially successful venture. In 1988, he played negative roles in films, such as Hatya, Zakhmi Aurat and Tezaab. Out of these releases, Hatya and Zakhmi Aurat were semi-hits, while the lattermost went many steps ahead and emerged a blockbuster as well as the highest earning film of that year. Kher's other notable release of 1988, Vijay failed at the box office, but won him his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.


=== Breakthrough, public recognition and awards success (1989–2001) ===
After many years of lukewarm critical and commercial success, Kher became a household name in 1989 when he starred in Subhash Ghai's masala film Ram Lakhan, Rajiv Rai's action drama Tridev, Yash Chopra's romantic musical Chandni, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's crime drama Parinda and Pankaj Parashar's comedy drama ChaalBaaz. All the films proved to be critically and commercially successful, especially Ram Lakhan, Tridev and Chandni, all three of which backed up with chartbuster music, emerged blockbusters at the box office and were among the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Apart from commercial projects, Kher also collaborated with Mahesh Bhatt for the art-house television film Daddy, which like their previous collaboration Saaransh met with immense acclaim and won Kher his first National Film Award – Special Jury Award as well as Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics). The following year, he starred in Indra Kumar's blockbuster romantic comedy Dil, which had Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit in the lead roles. For his performance of a greedy father in Dil, Kher received his third nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. In 1991, he appeared in highly successful films, including Saudagar, Saathi, Hum and Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin. He also collaborated with Yash Chopra for the romantic drama Lamhe, which was a commercial failure, but received positive reception from critics and is now considered a cult classic.

For his performance in the former, Kher received another nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category.
