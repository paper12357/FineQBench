== Synopsis ==
In the 1980s, at the beginning of China's Reform and opening-up when the economy was rapidly taking off, many entrepreneurs rode the rising wave of commerce. During this time, Chong Kin-wo, who had come from Shandong, was unexpectedly forced to remain in Hong Kong. To make a living, she began selling her family's traditional northern-style dumplings, gradually building what would become a globally popular dumpling brand.
With her two daughters, Madame Chong struggled to survive in a foreign place with no support. Since she had nothing, she resolved to rely on herself to carve out a new life. Despite being deceived by employers, worn down by illness, and crushed by hardship, her unyielding spirit would one day win applause from all who once doubted her. She is also supported by kindhearted neighbors such as Ms. Hung, Mr. Hua, and Uncle Tong sui.
