Dai Satō (佐藤 大, Satō Dai; born in 1969) is a Japanese screenwriter and musician.
Having begun scriptwriting at a young age and writing scripts for various companies, Satō later focused his attention on writing for anime series. The first major series he worked on was the groundbreaking 1998 Sunrise series Cowboy Bebop, after which he worked on other well-known series, such as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Wolf's Rain. In 2005, Satō was the chief writer of Psalms of Planets Eureka Seven, for which he received an award for best screenplay at the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2006.
In 2006 and 2007, Satō worked on the Sunrise OVA series Freedom Project (which featured director Katsuhiro Otomo).
Satō also created his own consultant company, Frognation, with two of his acquaintances, which incorporated he and his friend Kengo Watanabe's own electronic music label Frogman Records.
In 2007, after leaving Frognation, Satō established his own company Storyriders.
