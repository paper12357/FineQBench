== Early life ==
Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum was born on October 22, 1952 to Jewish parents in West Homestead, Pennsylvania, located just outside of Pittsburgh. His mother, Shirley Jane Goldblum (née Temeles; October 30, 1926 – January 9, 2012), was a radio broadcaster who later ran a kitchen equipment and appliances sales firm; his father, Harold Leonard Goldblum (April 25, 1920 – February 23, 1983), was a physician and major in the U.S. Army during World War II. His family was from the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, with roots in Starobin (now Belarus) and Zolochiv (now Ukraine). He has a sister, Pamela, and an elder brother, Lee. His other brother, Rick, whom Goldblum has described as a "kind of hero of mine", died in 1971 at age 23 while travelling in Morocco, having contracted dysentery which led to kidney failure. Goldblum, an accomplished jazz pianist, credits his interest in jazz music to Rick's influence while they were growing up. He has stated that his brother's early death made him "more focused" and gave him a determination to "save myself and survive".
During his childhood, his parents were interested in show business. His father nearly studied acting before deciding to pursue medical studies, going on to become chief of medicine at a Pittsburgh hospital. Goldblum moved to New York City at 17 to become an actor. He worked on the stage and studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse under the guidance of acting coach Sanford Meisner. He made his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical Two Gentlemen of Verona.

Goldblum starred as comedian Ernie Kovacs in the 1984 TV movie Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter. The movie dealt with the real-life kidnapping of Kovacs' two daughters by his former first wife.
