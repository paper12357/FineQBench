== Early life and education ==
Messing was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Sandra Ellen (née Simons), who worked as a professional singer, banker, and travel and real estate agent, and Brian Messing, a sales executive for a costume jewelry packaging manufacturer. Her family is Jewish, and emigrated to the U.S. from Russia; Przecław, Poland; and London, England. Messing had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony. When Messing was three, she moved with her parents and her older brother, Brett, to East Greenwich, Rhode Island.
While Messing's parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a liberal arts education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended Brandeis University, where, at her parents' request, three-quarters of her courses were not theater-related.
In 1990, after graduating summa cum laude from Brandeis with a Bachelor of Arts in Theater Arts, Messing gained admission to the elite Grad Acting Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, which accepts 16 new students annually. She earned a Master of Fine Arts after three years.

In 1993, Messing won acclaim for her performance as Harper in the pre-Broadway workshop production of Tony Kushner's play Angels in America: Perestroika. Subsequently, she appeared in several episodes of the television series NYPD Blue during 1994 and 1995.

In 1995, Messing made her film debut in Alfonso Arau's A Walk in the Clouds playing the unfaithful wife of main character Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves). This exposure led Fox to make her the co-star of the television sitcom Ned & Stacey. The series lasted for two seasons, from 1995 to 1997. Messing appeared as Jerry Seinfeld's romantic interest in two episodes of the series Seinfeld: "The Wait Out" in 1996 and "The Yada Yada" in 1997.

She also co-starred in the Tom Arnold vehicle McHale's Navy in 1997.
In 1998, Messing played a lead role as the bioanthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC's dramatic science-fiction television series Prey. During this time, her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show Will & Grace. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as Grace's romantic rival. Will & Grace became a ratings success, and Messing received critical acclaim for her performance.
Director Woody Allen cast Messing in a supporting role in his film Hollywood Ending (2002). Her film roles since include Richard Gere's ill-fated wife in the supernatural thriller The Mothman Prophecies (2002) and a supporting role as an unfaithful bride in Along Came Polly (2004).

In February 2011, producers announced that Messing would star in a new NBC musical pilot called Smash for the 2011–2012 primetime season.

Messing has been a vocal supporter of Israel since the October 7 attacks. In November 2023, she gave a speech at the March for Israel in Washington, D.C. On a December 2023 trip to Israel organized by the Creative Community for Peace, Messing met with members of the Israeli military and families of the hostages. 
Some social media users have expressed gratitude to Messing for sharing stories about the hostages and their families, while others have criticized her posts about the Gaza war as disregarding the Gaza humanitarian crisis and the Palestinian death toll. In January 2024, Messing was criticized for mocking Palestinian journalist Motaz Azaiza over his decision to leave the Gaza Strip amid Israel's killing of journalists.
Messing has also signed open letters related to the Gaza war, including letters criticizing Jonathan Glazer's Oscars acceptance speech for The Zone of Interest, Bisan Owda's Emmy nomination, and the Film Workers for Palestine boycott of Israeli film institutions.
