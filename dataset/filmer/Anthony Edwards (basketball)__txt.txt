Anthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed "Ant-Man" or simply "Ant", is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, Edwards played college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft. He is a three-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Second Team selection, and won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team.
Edwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest-rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team.


== Early life ==
Edwards spent his early life in Oakland City, Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old, he was given the nickname "Ant-Man" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions. He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10. Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he "thought it looked more fun" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball with his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training with Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.


== High school ==
Due to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016. He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class. In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had "small class sizes and support to help that."
In March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship. He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement. As a result, Edwards rose to become the number one recruit in the Top247 rankings by recruiting website 247Sports. In his senior season, his team finished as GISA Class AAA runners-up to The Heritage School, despite 27 points from Edwards. At the end of the season, he was averaging 29 points, nine rebounds, and two assists per game. Edwards garnered USA Today All-USA first team recognition. He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic in March and April 2019, respectively.


=== Recruiting ===
By consensus among major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals, Edwards was rated a five-star recruit, top-five player, and the top shooting guard in the 2019 class. On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era. Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina. He was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.

== Player profile ==
Edwards plays primarily as a shooting guard. He is listed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighs 225lb (102 kilograms). He’s known for his explosive athleticism, often going viral for his thunderous poster dunks, including one over John Collins that the NBA named the 2023–24 Dunk of the Year. The Ringer called him "a preposterous athlete with a nice jumper and better instincts". He’s drawn comparisons to a young Michael Jordan for his ability to finish around the rim. “They have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaway, the athleticism, the poster dunks… that same kind of work ethic, that same kind of ‘I don’t sleep at all at night because I’m ready to play, I’m ready to hoop,” according to teammate Mike Conley.
Despite pre-draft concerns that he was a limited long-range scorer, Edwards has developed an efficient, high-volume three-point shot — shooting 36% on eight attempts per game. He led the NBA in three-pointers made for the 2024–25 season. The same year, he became the youngest player in NBA history to make 1,000 threes.
His stout frame, lateral speed and competitiveness have helped transform his reputation on the defensive end — Team USA coach Steve Kerr called his on-ball defense “amazing” during the FIBA World Cup. His ability to match up against both long wings and shifty guards has garnered praise from Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch. Edwards himself believes his defense is “overlooked” by the national media. In 2024, he won the NBA Fan Favorite award for Block of Year after leaping to prevent a game-winning shot by the Pacers' Aaron Nesmith.
