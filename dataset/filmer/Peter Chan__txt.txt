=== Early career and breakthrough (1980s–1990s) ===
Peter Chan began his film career in the 1980s, serving as second assistant director, translator, and producer on John Woo's Heroes Shed No Tears (1986), set in Thailand. He then worked as a location manager on three Jackie Chan films: Wheels on Meals (1984), The Protector (1985), and Armour of God (1986), all shot overseas. In 1989, he joined Impact Films as a producer, guiding projects such as Curry and Pepper (1990) to completion.
Chan made his directorial debut with Alan and Eric: Between Hello and Goodbye in 1991, which won Best Film at the Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild and Best Actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards for Eric Tsang. This period also saw him co-founding the United Filmmakers Organization (UFO) in the early 1990s, which produced several box-office hits, including his own He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father (1993), Tom, Dick and Hairy (1993), He's a Woman, She's a Man (1994), and the internationally acclaimed Comrades, Almost a Love Story (1997) starring Maggie Cheung and Leon Lai. This film, often hailed as one of the greatest Chinese-language films ever made, catapulted Chan into international prominence and set the tone for his career as a director, producer and tireless advocate of the Chinese-language film industry.


=== Hollywood and pan-Asian collaborations (late 1990s–2000s) ===
In the late 1990s, Chan directed The Love Letter, a Hollywood film starring Kate Capshaw, Ellen DeGeneres, and Tom Selleck. In 2000, he co-founded Applause Pictures, where he spearheaded a drive to make Pan-Asian films for the region’s audiences, resulting in hits such as Jan Dara by Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr, One Fine Spring Day South Korea's Hur Jin-ho, The Eye by Danny and Oxide Pang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle, The Eye sequals and its US remake. It also fostered collaborations with directors such as Park Chan-wook and Takashi Miike.
Since the mid-2000s, Chan has predominantly worked in mainland China, capitalizing on the rapid expansion of its film industry. His 2005 musical film Perhaps Love, a Hong Kong-mainland China co-production, closed the Venice Film Festival and was Hong Kong's entry for the Academy Awards' Best Foreign Film category. Perhaps Love became one of the top-grossing films of the year in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, winning a record 29 awards. Chan also directed The Warlords (2007) and produced Derek Yee's Protégé (2007), both of which were the highest-grossing Hong Kong-China co-productions of the year. The Warlords won 8 Hong Kong Film Awards and 3 Golden Horse Awards, including Best Director and Best Feature Film.


=== Continued success and advocacy (2010s–present) ===
In 2009, Chan founded We Pictures, a production company aimed at supporting, producing and distributing films from a range of Chinese artists. That same year, he produced Teddy Chan's Bodyguards and Assassins, which won eight Hong Kong Film Awards, including Best Film. Chan's reputation was solidified when he was voted "the most valuable filmmaker" in a 2010 survey by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
Chan's 2011 martial arts film Dragon premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, the only Chinese-language film in that year's selection. Time Magazine named Wu Xia one of the top ten films of 2012. In 2020, his drama Leap, about the Chinese women's volleyball Olympic team, represented Mainland China and showcased his ability to navigate various genres.
In 2022, Chan launched the production company Changin' Pictures to create streaming content.
Chan’s new film, She’s Got No Name (2024), marks his second time in official selection at the Cannes Film Festival after Dragon.


=== Ongoing contributions ===
Throughout his career, Chan has leveraged his Thai heritage to engage in Pan-Asian film initiatives. His recent endeavor seeks to collaborate with a broad spectrum of South Asian and Southeast Asian filmmakers. By forming solidarity with notable directors like Kabir Khan, Kiran Rao, and Banjong Pisanthanakun, Chan aims to foster cross-pollination with filmmakers across a wider range throughout the continent, contributing to the growth and diversity of the region's cinema.
Chan's legacy is defined by his versatility, advocacy, and enduring impact on the Chinese-language film industry. His numerous accolades, including being the first director to win Best Director awards at the Hong Kong Film Awards, the Golden Horse Awards, and the China Golden Rooster Awards, underscore his remarkable talent and influential presence in the world of cinema.
