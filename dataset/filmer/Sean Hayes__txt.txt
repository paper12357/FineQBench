== Personal life ==
Hayes refused to discuss his sexual orientation for many years, saying he believed that audiences would therefore be more open-minded about his characters. Nevertheless, after the success of Will & Grace, he was frustrated to find himself typecast, only receiving offers for gay roles. To avoid questions about his sexuality, he declined interview offers from gay publications during the run of the show. In response to a satirical piece run in The Advocate, which criticized him for being opaque about his sexual orientation, he appeared to imply that he is gay, stating: "Really? You're gonna shoot the gay guy down? I never have had a problem saying who I am. I am who I am." He also indicated that he was in a relationship. He feels he has "contributed monumentally to the success of the gay movement in America, and if anyone wants to argue that, I'm open to it." After he received Outfest's Trailblazer Award in 2016 he addressed this criticism in his speech, saying in part: "Looking back at my choice to stay silent, I am ashamed and embarrassed. What was I thinking? [...] I know I should've come out sooner, and I'm sorry for that, especially when I think about the possibility that I might have made a difference in someone's life."
He received an honorary PhD from Illinois State University in February 2013. In November 2014, Hayes announced that he had married his partner of eight years, Scott Icenogle. In October 2017, while appearing on an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Hayes revealed that he had been hospitalized with a rare condition in which his small intestine burst. The intestine was repaired.
Hayes has been open about living with atrial fibrillation, a cardiac disorder that causes him to frequently visit the ER to get his heart shocked back into sinus rhythm whenever his heartbeat is too irregular or rapid. About his condition, Hayes has said, "When I go to the ER, I'm like Norm from 'Cheers.' They're like, 'Sean!', because I'm in there all the time."
