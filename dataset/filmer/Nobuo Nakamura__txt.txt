Nobuo Nakamura (中村伸郎, Nakamura Nobuo; September 14, 1908 – July 5, 1991) was a Japanese stage and film actor, who appeared in many films by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujirō Ozu and Mikio Naruse.


== Biography ==
A graduate from Tokyo Kaisei Junior High School, Nakamura studied at the Kawabata School of Painting. After the rejection of his work at an exhibition, he decided to become a stage actor instead, making his stage debut in 1932. He joined the Bungakuza theatre company in 1938, which he left in the wake of the "Harp of Joy incident" (the Bungakuza ensemble had split over the refusal of some of its members to perform Yukio Mishima's play The Harp of Joy) to become a founding member of the Geikan NLT theatre group in 1964, which staged many of Mishima's plays. He later joined the theatre groups Roman Theatre and En Theatre Group.
Nakamura started appearing in films regularly in the 1950s. Notable works in his filmography include Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru and Throne of Blood, Yasujirō Ozu's Tokyo Story and Late Autumn, and Mikio Naruse's Flowing.
